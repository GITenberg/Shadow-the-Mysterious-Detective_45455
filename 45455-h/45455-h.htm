<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY.</a></h2>


<p>Again I have been called on to entertain my wide circle of
young friends, by relating another story of detective life. Before
plunging into my story, I have thought it best to address
a few words to you personally, and about myself.</p>

<p>It is held as a rule that an author should never introduce
himself into the story he is writing, and yet I find, on looking
back, that in nearly all of my recent stories I have described
myself as playing a more or less conspicuous part.</p>

<p>And yet I could not avoid doing so, as I can plainly see,
without having detracted somewhat of interest from the stories.</p>

<p>As I sit here now, prepared to commence, the question
arises: "Shall I keep myself in the background, out of sight,
or shall I bring myself in, just as I actually took part in the
strange story of</p>

<p class="center">
"'<span class="smcap">Shadow, the Mysterious Detective?</span>'"<br />
</p>

<p>Well, I don't know, but I think it may be just as well to introduce
myself when necessary, since when I write thus I feel
that my pen is talking to you instead of at you. And, besides,
I think that to you the story is more realistic.</p>

<p>Am I right?</p>

<p>Don't each of you feel now as if I had written you a personal
letter? And are you not satisfied that there is only one
Police Captain Howard, and he that one who now speaks to
you?</p>

<p>I am sure of it.</p>

<p>And now for the story.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A MURDER.</p>


<p>It was a dark and stormy night. The rain fell heavily and
steadily, and what wind there was roamed through the streets
with a peculiar, moaning sound.</p>

<p>It was after the midnight hour.</p>

<p>Not a light was to be seen in any of the houses, nor was
there any sound to be heard save that produced by the falling
rain, and that soughing of the wind&mdash;not unlike the sighs and
moans of some uneasy spirit unable to rest in the grave.</p>

<p>It was as disagreeable a night as I ever saw. And I could
not help shuddering as I hurried homeward through the storm,
with bent head, for I felt somewhat as if I were passing
through a city of the dead.</p>

<p>This heavy silence&mdash;except for the noises mentioned&mdash;was
very oppressive; and, while I gave a start, I was also conscious
of a sense of relief, when I heard a human voice
shouting:</p>

<p>"Help&mdash;help!"</p>

<p>I paused short.</p>

<p>My head having been bent, the cry coming so unexpectedly,
I could not locate its direction.</p>

<p>Presently it came again.</p>

<p>"Help, for Heaven's sake, help!"</p>

<p>Off I dashed to the rescue.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Then came a wild wail.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Then I heard a thud, as of a human being falling heavily to
the sidewalk. And as the person uttered no further cries, one
of two things must be the case&mdash;he was either insensible or
dead.</p>

<p>I increased my pace, and presently turning a corner, saw a
burly fellow just dragging a body beneath a gas-lamp, the
better to enable him to secure the plunder on his victim's
body.</p>

<p>The assassin had already secured most of the stricken
man's valuables, when my rapid approach alarmed him, and
jumping up, he sprang along the street at a break-neck pace.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>I had drawn a revolver, and I sent a couple of bullets after
him, hoping to wing him, as well as to extend the alarm which
his shots must already have raised.</p>

<p>A policeman put in an appearance some distance down the
street, but the flying murderer took a running leap at him,
tumbled him head over heels into the gutter, and then succeeded
in making his escape.</p>

<p>When I compared notes with the policeman, I found that
neither of us had distinctly enough seen the murderer to be able
to give any description of him whatever, save that he was a
chunky-built man, and seemed roughly dressed.</p>

<p>We were not surprised, on examining into the prostrate
man's condition, to find him dead.</p>

<p>Right in the center of his forehead was a small hole, edged
with drying, clotted blood, which mutely said:</p>

<p>"Here entered the fatal messenger from a death-dealing
weapon."</p>

<p>The body was conveyed to the station-house, there to remain
until it was claimed or conveyed to the morgue.</p>

<p>An examination of the pockets resulted in our learning that
his name was Tom Smith. As to his residence, we could find
no clew from anything he had on his person, or by consulting
the directory.</p>

<p>About two o'clock the next afternoon, a wild-eyed woman
entered the station-house, and, in trembling tones, asked to
see the body.</p>

<p>I was present at the time, and my heart went out in pity to
the pale-faced woman&mdash;or perhaps I should say girl, for she
certainly had not seen her twentieth birthday.</p>

<p>She disappeared into the inner room where the body was
lying, and a few seconds later I heard a low and anguished
cry. Then I knew that she had recognized the poor fellow as
some one who was near and dear to her.</p>

<p>Kindly hands drew her away from beside the body, and
when I saw her again her face was convulsed with anguish,
and tears were streaming from her eyes.</p>

<p>For fully half an hour she continued weeping, and not a
man of us was there who did not feel uncomfortable. We did
not venture to console her, for it seemed like sacrilege to intrude
on her during the first period of her sorrow.</p>

<p>Then her sobbing became less loud, and gradually she subdued
the more demonstrative expressions of grief.</p>

<p>She finally lifted her head, and in a hollow voice asked to
hear the story of his death.</p>

<p>The captain briefly outlined what was known, and she calmly
listened to the tale.</p>

<p>"Can I see the person who first reached him?" she asked,
when the captain had finished.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. "Detective Howard here is the
man you want."</p>

<p>She wished to see me alone, and I conducted her into
another room.</p>

<p>Arrived here, she begged me minutely to relate what had
happened; and, exhibiting a singular self-control, asked for
as close a description of the assassin as I could give.</p>

<p>"You knew him very well?" said I, when an opportunity
occurred.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was your brother?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, and a faint flush flitted into her pallid face
for an instant. "No," and then her voice sank to a whisper,
"he was to have been my husband."</p>

<p>"Ah! And now, miss, you don't suppose that the assassin
could have been an enemy of his? Did he have any enemies,
who might rob him, as a blind to cover up their real motive?"</p>

<p>"Tom have an enemy? No&mdash;no&mdash;he was too good and kind
for that. It was done by some murderous wretch for the sake
of plunder. Tom must have resisted being robbed, and the
ruffian killed him."</p>

<p>"That is my own theory. And&mdash;I do not wish to pain you,
miss&mdash;but what about the body? Has he any family or relations?"</p>

<p>"No, none in this world. He and I were all in all to each
other," and the eyes of the girl became moist again; but she
fought back the tears, and quite calmly said:</p>

<p>"I will take care of the body."</p>

<p>Then a troubled expression crossed her face; and, to make
a long story short, I gained her confidence, learned that she
had not enough to properly inter her lover, and loaned her the
money.</p>

<p>With tears of gratitude in her eyes, she thanked me, and
every word came straight from her heart.</p>

<p>Her name was Nellie Millbank, she said, and she was utterly
alone in the world. Until several days before, she had been
employed in a store, but had then been discharged.</p>

<p>Tom was a clerk, but had only a small salary, as soon as
which was raised they were to have been married. He had
been to see her on that fatal night, to tell her he had obtained
a day off, and was going to take her on an excursion on the
morrow.</p>

<p>She had been dressed and waiting for him, but he had not
come.</p>

<p>Alarmed, for he had always kept his word, she knew not
what to do, nor what to think, until, having bought an afternoon
paper, she saw an account of the shooting.</p>

<p>This was her simple history.</p>

<p>After the inquest, the body was delivered to her, and then
she faded from my sight and knowledge for a long while.
Exactly how long, the ensuing chapters will inform you.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="center">MAT MORRIS.</p>


<p>"I've been discharged, mother."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I've been discharged."</p>

<p>The face of Mrs. Morris became very grave, and presently her
eyes were turned on the boyish yet manly face of her son Mat.
Earnestly she gazed at him for several seconds, and then her
lips parted with a smile which, wan as it was, expressed satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It was no fault of yours. You did nothing wrong, my
son?"</p>

<p>"No, mother, it was not through any fault of mine that I
was discharged. Business has fallen off so very much of late
that they were compelled to reduce the number of hands.
And as I was one of the newest, I was among those laid off."</p>

<p>"Of course I am sorry," said poor Mrs. Morris, "but we
must do the best we can."</p>

<p>"I'll not act the part of a sluggard, mother, you can depend
on that. I'll try and find something to do to keep the wolf
from the door. And my boss gave me a splendid recommendation,
and said if business got better he'd send for me at
once."</p>

<p>Mat was a good son.</p>

<p>Few better were to be found.</p>

<p>His worst fault, perhaps, was in being a little reckless, or
over-brave and independent.</p>

<p>None could insult him with impunity, nor could he nor
would he stand by and silently witness anybody being imposed
upon. He invariably took the part of the under dog in the
fight.</p>

<p>Hardly had Mat finished speaking, when the door opened
and a girl entered; a girl whom both mother and son greeted
with glances of affection.</p>

<p>Her name was Helen Dilt.</p>

<p>Five years before, when the circumstances of the Morris
family had been better, they had taken her from the street&mdash;found
starving and freezing there on a cold winter's night&mdash;and
had cared for her.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris had died only a year later, since which time
Helen had clung to them, doing what little she could to keep
the roof above their heads.</p>

<p>She was not yet sixteen&mdash;a slight and winsome little creature;
not beautiful, but with a sweet face that when lighted
by a smile was remarkably winning.</p>

<p>Of her history she knew nothing.</p>

<p>Her knowledge of herself could be summed up in a few words.</p>

<p>For years cared for by a drunken old hag, with only a faint
remembrance of a sweet, sad face before that, she had lost
even such a squalid home as she had when the hag died.</p>

<p>Then she had come with the Morris family.</p>

<p>And well did they love her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris loved her like a daughter, and Mat loved her
much better than a sister. And Helen returned the latter's
deep regard.</p>

<p>While no word had openly been spoken, it was tacitly understood
by all three that some day, when Mat and Helen
were old enough, and the circumstances permitted, they were to
be married.</p>

<p>Mat was of slight build, of lithe and willowy frame, in which,
however, resided an amount of strength which few would have
dreamed possible.</p>

<p>He was just eighteen.</p>

<p>There is an old saying&mdash;"that it never rains but it pours."</p>

<p>It seems true sometimes.</p>

<p>Helen, employed in a situation bringing her three dollars a
week, had also come home with the news of having been discharged.</p>

<p>It was a grave little trio that gathered about the supper
table that night.</p>

<p>Latterly they had been getting along comfortably, but now
destitution and want again stared them in the face, and must
inevitably take up quarters in the household, unless some one
obtained work of some kind to bring in some money.</p>

<p>Mat was up and away early the next morning, and for many
mornings thereafter, but although he honestly searched all
day long for employment, none was to be found.</p>

<p>And Helen, too, sought for work, but failed to find it, and
day by day their slender stock of money diminished, until at
last they had eaten the last meal, and had no money wherewith
to buy another.</p>

<p>That evening Helen left the house and was gone for a short
while, and when she came back she did not say where she had
been.</p>

<p>But she had gone with her shawl to a pawn-shop, and hid
away in her dress was the pittance which had been loaned
on it.</p>

<p>In the morning she stole out unheard, not long after daylight,
and invested her capital in newspapers.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were flushed with shame as she stood on the
street, offering her papers for sale. But she fought back her
pride. They had been very kind to her, and she should be only
too glad, she told herself, to make the sacrifice for their dear
sakes.</p>

<p>And how happy she was when she hastened to their home,
and put her morning's earnings into the hand of Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>In vain Mat protested against Helen's selling papers. Let
him do it, he said.</p>

<p>"It will need all we can both make to live and pay the
rent," Helen quietly returned.</p>

<p>"But you must not go on the street to sell papers, Helen,"
protested Mat.</p>

<p>"I am young and can afford better to do this than that our
good mother should work," said Helen, bravely, casting an
affectionate glance toward Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>And Mat said no more.</p>

<p>It was one day several weeks subsequent to the time when
she first began selling papers, that a gentleman stopped to
purchase a <i>Herald</i> of Helen.</p>

<p>He had paid for it in a mechanical way, and was turning
away when he chanced to glance at the face of the newsgirl.</p>

<p>He started slightly, then cast a keen glance at her, paused,
and then in a tone of assumed carelessness, asked:</p>

<p>"Haven't I seen you somewhere else, my girl? You have
not always sold papers?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Where can I have seen you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," was the only reply, for Helen did not
care to talk to him.</p>

<p>But she saw that he was an elderly man, his hair was
streaked with gray, and in clothing and manner he bore the
impress of apparent respectability.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Helen."</p>

<p>"What!" with another start. "Your name is Helen, is
it?" recovering himself. "Helen what, my girl?"</p>

<p>"Helen Morris," was the reply, for she had now for a long
time used the name of her benefactors as her own.</p>

<p>Again the gentleman glanced keenly at her, and then moved
away slowly, muttering to himself:</p>

<p>"Morris&mdash;Morris! I can't understand it. That likeness is
wonderful, and cannot exist as a mere accident. I must investigate
this, and I'd bet anything that that is not her name."</p>

<p>The gentleman entered a large building on Broadway, ascended
in the elevator, and opened the door of an office, on
which was lettered the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Joseph Brown</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><i>Attorney at Law</i>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Having written a note, he dispatched his office boy with it
to a liquor saloon, it being directed to James McGinnis, in
care of the saloon's proprietor.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon a beetle-browed and forbidding-looking
individual entered Brown's office.</p>

<p>"Well, I got your letter and I've come!" was the rather
sullen salutation he gave Brown. "What's up now? Want
to badger me again?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me in that manner!" said Brown, quietly, yet
in a grim tone. "Remember that I saved your neck from a
halter, which I can again put around it at any moment."</p>

<p>The man shuddered, and became meek as a lamb.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"That's better," and Brown smiled. "I don't want much
of you just now," and then he sank his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"That's easy enough," McGinnis said, a few minutes later.
"I can let you know to-morrow morning, I think."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>When McGinnis put in an appearance the next morning, it
was evident from his expression that he had been successful
in the task required of him by Brown.</p>

<p>"I've found out that her name isn't Morris. That's the
name of the people as she lives with. She's a kind of an
adopted daughter, and they said as how her real name was
Dilk, or something like that."</p>

<p>"Ha! I thought so," Brown exclaimed, inwardly. And then
he bade McGinnis sit down, and for nearly half an hour they
conversed in low tones.</p>

<p>Then Brown put a roll of bills into his confederate's hands,
and the latter withdrew, saying:</p>

<p>"I'll do the job nately, and there'll be no trouble after it."</p>

<p>And that night Helen did not return home. Half-crazed
with alarm, Mat and his mother awaited her coming until
nine o'clock, or a little after, and then the young fellow could
stand it no longer, but went in search of Helen.</p>

<p>He could not find her.</p>

<p>She did not return during the night, nor even the next day,
nor when night again fell.</p>

<p>Mat had scoured the city for her, had visited the places
where she usually sold papers, and had questioned all the boot-blacks
and newsboys, but had only obtained the meager and
unsatisfactory information from one little fellow that he had
seen Helen in company with a man just after dusk.</p>

<p>She had disappeared completely, had vanished as utterly as
a mist that is dissolved by the sun's warm rays.</p>

<p>"She is gone from us, mother," Mat at last said, in a choking
voice. "You remember, mother, what Helen has told us&mdash;her
impressions concerning her early childhood. And,
mother, I believe there is money at the bottom of the thing,
that Helen stood in somebody's way, and has been spirited off
by this person's orders."</p>

<p>"It is possible."</p>

<p>"Possible! I feel it to be the truth. And I shall not rest
night or day, mother, until I have found her. Good-bye,
mother, for I am going. Heaven in mercy assist you and
care for you until I can come back to do so. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris did not wish him to go, but she could not
thwart him, for she knew how much he loved Helen. But her
face was very pale and anguished as she saw him go.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SHADOW&mdash;WHO WAS HE?</p>


<p>Mat Morris was grimly in earnest in his determination to
find the missing Helen.</p>

<p>He had no clew to follow, no starting-point from which to
begin his search, but he would not permit himself to think
about it in this light, for fear he would become discouraged.</p>

<p>Helen was alive&mdash;was somewhere&mdash;could be found&mdash;and
must be found!</p>

<p>First of all, he paid a visit to police head-quarters, and described
the man who had been seen with Helen, as the boy
had described him.</p>

<p>From one detective to another he went, giving the description,
and inquiring if any could say who tallied in appearance
with it.</p>

<p>Among the others he came to me, but, like the others, I
could not even guess who the person might be, so meager was
the description.</p>

<p>I asked him if he intended turning detective himself.</p>

<p>"I do," he firmly said; "and I shall never give up until I
have found her, and unearthed the rascal who has done
this."</p>

<p>"Who is this 'her' you speak of?"</p>

<p>"A girl whom I love dearer than my life itself!" was the
earnest reply&mdash;not given in a mawkish and sentimental tone,
but in a manly way that won for the speaker my good opinion.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you," I said. "Tell me your story."</p>

<p>He did so, but so little did it contain that I could see no
advice to give him, and told him so frankly.</p>

<p>"I like you for your frankness," said Mat; "but say no
more or you may discourage me."</p>

<p>I asked him his name, and when he had told me what it
was, I found that I had known his father.</p>

<p>"I hope you may be successful&mdash;I sincerely hope so," I told
him, as we shook hands at parting.</p>

<p>Mat Morris went his road and I went mine, and in the busy
details of my life soon forgot him.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a lot of us detectives were grouped together,
discussing an offer of a reward of one thousand dollars for the
discovery of some stolen bonds and the person who had made
free with them.</p>

<p>The known facts of the case were in our possession, and
when I sat in my room that evening, recalling them one by
one, it struck me that a certain criminal might have had a
hand in the affair, for the method of making the robbery was
in his style.</p>

<p>Singular as it may seem, nearly every professional thief has
a method of working up his "jobs," and a detective very
frequently can positively say: "Such and such a person had a
hand in that affair," merely because they know the style and
method of the work.</p>

<p>I put on my coat and hat and went out, my footsteps turned
in the direction of this person's haunts.</p>

<p>As I drew near to a saloon which he was accustomed to
frequent, I caught sight of the very individual, and followed
him.</p>

<p>He passed the saloon, and going on, turned the next corner.</p>

<p>I hastened forward, was about to turn the corner, when a
slight thing brought me suddenly to a halt.</p>

<p>It was nothing more nor less than a simple shadow, cast on
the walk by a gaslight. It was the shadow of a slender figure,
in male attire, a cap on the head, one hand raised, while the
index finger was being shaken after somebody in the distance.</p>

<p>Simple as the circumstance was it impressed me, and I stood
still and waited.</p>

<p>My eyes wandered from the shadow for an instant, and
when my eyes sought the spot where it had been, it was gone.</p>

<p>I sprang to the corner.</p>

<p>The criminal whom I had been following was out of sight,
and the person who had cast that shadow was nowhere visible.</p>

<p>And yet I had heard no footsteps, and the time anyhow was
too brief for the person to have gone more than a dozen feet.</p>

<p>I was deeply puzzled.</p>

<p>Soon after I turned my steps toward home, for I was balked
for the present, whatever else might be the case. I remember
just before leaving the spot that I muttered, rather loud, perhaps:</p>

<p>"Where did that shadow disappear to so suddenly?"</p>

<p>The next day these words were recalled to my mind when a
note was handed to me, and I had opened it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The bonds are hidden under the dock at the foot of &mdash;&mdash;
street. The person who stole them will recover them to-night.
Capture him. Claim the reward; keep half, and be ready to
give the other half at an instant's demand to</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Shadow</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Let the word answer as a countersign."</p>

<p>This note puzzled me not a little, and I hardly knew what to
do in regard to it; for I did not wish to be made a fool of, as
well as the laughing-stock of the other detectives.</p>

<p>I finally determined to tack my faith to this unknown person
who signed "Shadow," and that night took a couple of
men to the spot designated, and captured the bond thief after
he had taken the bonds from their hiding-place.</p>

<p>I got the reward, and kept five hundred myself, reserving
the other five hundred until it should be demanded of me,
when, where, or how, I had not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>Several weeks later, after the midnight hour, I was suddenly
brought to a halt as I drew near my house, for across the walk
was cast that shadow.</p>

<p>I knew it must be the same one, and belonging to the same
person, for the hand was raised, and the index finger shaking.</p>

<p>Determined that this shadow should not disappear so suddenly
and mysteriously again, I kept my eyes on it as I
hastily sprang forward.</p>

<p>The shadow moved, and its owner suddenly stood before me&mdash;a
lithe figure, in male attire, with a large-peaked cap.</p>

<p>I glanced keenly at the face.</p>

<p>It was a boyish-looking face, with eyes very deep-set, it
seemed to me, and a face, besides, that lacked expression.</p>

<p>"Shadow!" was uttered by a low voice, evidently disguised,
and then a hand was extended&mdash;for the money, as I well knew.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Shadow!" was the single word of reply.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well. If you are villainous enough to
keep it all, why, do so!" and he would have glided away.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Here is your share. And now, who are you?"
and I bent closer to the mysterious being, and then discovered
that I did not see a real face, but a closely-fitting mask, which
defied all but the closest scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I am Shadow."</p>

<p>"A detective?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Now go&mdash;leave me alone&mdash;cease your questioning.
And, as you value my friendship (which may be worth much
to you) never speak to me again, but act simply as I shall
write. You have compelled me to break an oath&mdash;be satisfied
and go; and never cause me to break a new oath, which I
now again make, or I swear solemnly that you shall regret it."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Shadow, and then he went swiftly away, with
the most noiseless steps of any human being I ever saw.</p>

<p>I took a few steps in the same direction, but I paused when
he turned and shook that index finger at me in that peculiar
way.</p>

<p>He was a deep mystery to me.</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>Disguised as a sailor just arrived in port, I shadowed a man
into a low dive some nights later.</p>

<p>Two professional burglars, well known to me, passed near
me as I crossed the room.</p>

<p>"Could that little chap have overheard anything we said?"
one rather anxiously asked of the other.</p>

<p>"No," was the careless reply. "I've seen him before, and
know that he's deaf and dumb. If it hadn't been for that, I'd
a told you of his being near us."</p>

<p>Thus much I heard, and then distance swallowed up the
sound of their voices.</p>

<p>I glanced around in quest of the little chap alluded to, and
my eyes lighted on&mdash;Shadow!</p>

<p>Was he playing deaf and dumb?</p>

<p>I got near him after a while, and managed to whisper into
his ear:</p>

<p>"I know you now. I detected you from the way you carry
your head&mdash;you are Mat Morris."</p>

<p>Shadow's hand was resting on the table. Without even
glancing up to see if I was looking, his index finger began
forming letters on the table&mdash;letters, of course, that were invisible.</p>

<p>My eyes followed the finger carefully, and I read the words:</p>

<p>"Fool! Your folly may cost us both our lives. I am
Shadow&mdash;nothing else. Do not seek to penetrate my disguise.
Go."</p>

<p>I turned away rebuked.</p>

<p>If he wished to conceal his identity, it certainly was none
of my business.</p>

<p>As I was turning about, a genuine tar&mdash;a regular son of
Neptune&mdash;staggered against me. He was half seas over, and
I tried to avoid him.</p>

<p>But he grasped me by the shoulder, gave me a shake,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come along and have some grog, you son of a sea-cook!"</p>

<p>I tried to get away from him, and to keep up my assumed
character was foolish enough to attempt using a sailor-like
phrase.</p>

<p>No sooner had the tar heard my words than he bellowed
out:</p>

<p>"Hurroo&mdash;hurroo! Shiver my timbers if ye ever smelt salt
water! You're no tar&mdash;smash my headlights if ye are! Can't
play that game on me," following his speech with a hearty
guffaw.</p>

<p>He raised his hand to slap me on the shoulder, and his
fingers caught in and dragged off the bushy whiskers I had
put on for a disguise.</p>

<p>All eyes had been drawn to us by the drunken sailor's words,
and when my face was seen there was a start of alarm on all
sides.</p>

<p>Some one recognized me.</p>

<p>"A detective&mdash;a detective!"</p>

<p>And then a hoarse and angry murmur was heard on every
side, and I was slowly hemmed in by a crowd of scowling-faced
villains.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OUT OF THE LION'S JAWS.</p>


<p>Things looked remarkably squally where I was concerned,
when, on my exposure by the genuine tar, the inmates of the
den gathered threateningly about me.</p>

<p>I attempted to draw my shooting-irons, but desisted as a
measure of prudence when I saw that I should be killed before
being allowed to do so.</p>

<p>It might have gone very hard with me, had it not been
for the quick-wittedness of the mysterious being known as
Shadow.</p>

<p>Several empty beer-glasses were on the table in front of
him.</p>

<p>These he caught up, and swiftly and accurately hurled
them at the lights&mdash;lamps being used in the place instead of
gas.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Ban-n-n-g!</p>

<p>One of the heavy beer-glasses had smashed the bottom of
one of the lamps, the oil had ignited, and there came an explosion,
followed by the burning oil being scattered in every
direction.</p>

<p>Instantly ensued a scene of confusion and consternation.</p>

<p>The oil had set fire to the clothing of several persons, and
they cursed and screamed and shouted, as they wildly strove
to smother the flames.</p>

<p>Now was my opportunity.</p>

<p>Toward the door I made my way through the surging and
excited crowd, some of whom were madly grasping at each
other, thinking they were laying hold on me.</p>

<p>By the fluttering blaze of the burning, oil-soaked clothing
of the persons on fire, I saw which way to go; and I had nearly
reached the door, when some one cried:</p>

<p>"Be careful, boys! Look out for the door; don't let him
escape!"</p>

<p>I made a bolt for the door, and reached it just after another
person had done so.</p>

<p>I up with my clenched fist and toppled him over, and then
dashed into the street and took to my heels, and did not halt
until I was a block from the place.</p>

<p>This was not caused by fear, for I could easily have summoned
half a dozen policemen to my assistance.</p>

<p>No matter how wicked a man may be, he has rights under
the law as well as anybody else, and unless I knew or suspected
him (for good reasons) to be guilty of some particular
crime, I had no business to interfere with him.</p>

<p>So I did not wish to make any further move by making any
arrests of the inmates of the dive.</p>

<p>Nor, on the contrary, did I wish to give them an opportunity
of putting a surreptitious bullet in me.</p>

<p>And again, I had begun to consider Shadow as an ally of
mine, and did not wish to run the risk of upsetting or balking
any scheme he might be working up through his presence in
that place.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I naturally felt resentful toward the men who,
for a moment, had my life in their power, and who seemed inclined
to use their power. But I knew them all, and I would
have my revenge when, some day&mdash;as they surely would&mdash;they
fell into the strong grasp of the law.</p>

<p>I hung around the vicinity for an hour or more, but as I
saw nothing of Shadow, I concluded to turn my steps homeward,
and did so.</p>

<p>And Shadow?</p>

<p>He, too, had started toward the door, but had been too
slow in his movements to reach it before it was barricaded.</p>

<p>Made aware that he could not pass through it, he quietly
made his way back to where he had been sitting, and there
sat down again, just before a lamp was hastily lighted.</p>

<p>By this time the ignited clothing had all been extinguished,
with no more results than a few painful burns, and consequently
the first thought of everybody was concerning the detective.</p>

<p>But he was gone.</p>

<p>That somebody had escaped they knew, but had clung to
the hope that it was one of the tars, who had been frightened
and bolted out.</p>

<p>But, no, the half-drunken sailors were all huddled together,
gazing stupidly about them, not knowing what was to come
next.</p>

<p>Some of them had drawn the tar's never-absent companion,
their dirk-knives, and were prepared to make resistance in
case all this row was but a blind to cover up an attack on them
for the purpose of robbing them.</p>

<p>But robbing the tars was the thing furthest from the minds
of that rascally crew just at that moment.</p>

<p>They had threatened the life of a detective, he had escaped,
and they thought the consequences would be a descent on the
place, as soon as enough blue-coats could be gathered for the
purpose.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;who fired those beer-glasses?"</p>

<p>The bullet-headed proprietor of the "ranch" asked this
question in a gruff tone.</p>

<p>Instantly they began eying each other, and slowly but surely
pair after pair of eyes were fastened on Shadow.</p>

<p>"Run out these Jacks."</p>

<p>Immediately the tars were told to "vamose"&mdash;"vacate"&mdash;"skip"&mdash;and
the door being held open for them, they lost no
time in giving the place a wide berth.</p>

<p>The proprietor sharply eyed those who remained.</p>

<p>All were friends.</p>

<p>Making a sign to a couple, they separated from the rest,
who were then told to "skip and lay low."</p>

<p>Shadow made no attempt to leave with this departing crowd.</p>

<p>He knew that it would be useless, in addition to which it
would have implied that he had heard and understood, which
would not have been in keeping with his assumed character
of a deaf and dumb person.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the bullet-headed proprietor, when none
but a trusted few were left in the place, "into that 'cubby' of
ours with him!" indicating Shadow.</p>

<p>The latter eyed them with blank astonishment when they
laid hands on him, and signed to know what it meant. And
when they commenced running him across the floor, he struggled
to prevent them.</p>

<p>But he became quiet when one of them placed the muzzle of
a revolver to his temple.</p>

<p>He made no further resistance, but allowed them to gag
him, and shove him into a little black cubby-hole or closet,
whose door was a segment of the wainscoting, undiscoverable
to a person unaware of its existence, save by the closest
scrutiny.</p>

<p>The door was banged shut, and Shadow was left to his own
reflections in the cramped confines of the dark and moldy-smelling
closet.</p>

<p>He was left here until all danger of a raid was thought by
the proprietor to be past.</p>

<p>Then he was brought out.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by smashing the lamps and putting
them out?" was sternly demanded of him.</p>

<p>Shadow looked vacantly at them.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" and he was given a cuff alongside of his
head. "Come, give us an answer, or I'll 'liven you up with
something heavier than my hand."</p>

<p>While looking wonderingly and inquiringly at them Shadow
pointed first to his mouth and then to his ear.</p>

<p>One of them held a revolver close to the back of his head,
unseen by him, and then cocked the weapon, thinking that at
the click Shadow would certainly give a start if he was not
really deaf.</p>

<p>Not a muscle of face or body could be seen to even twitch.</p>

<p>"It's straight, I guess," said this fellow, as he let down the
hammer of the weapon and returned it to his pocket.</p>

<p>They now repeated the question by writing it on a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>Shadow looked at it, his face brightened, and seizing the
pencil, he scribbled the reply:</p>

<p>"I knew him for a detective! I thought you'd rush in on
him in the dark and slug him!"</p>

<p>The villains looked at each other. There was reason in it.
Darkness might easily have proved an aid to them, although,
as it chanced, it had really opened the way for the detective's
escape.</p>

<p>Then they scrutinized Shadow closely, and tried to intimidate
him by saying they did not believe it. But when they
wrote this on paper, Shadow only shrugged his shoulders on
reading it.</p>

<p>Then they discussed the advisability of letting him go or
putting him out of the way.</p>

<p>"There's no good in killing him, as I can see," one said
finally. "It might easily be a bad thing, for there's no tellin'
who may show up here afore the body could be got rid of,"
and in this view all at last concurred.</p>

<p>Shadow was led to the door and pointed out. He hastily
gained the street&mdash;<i>and disappeared</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HELEN DILT.</p>


<p>There are thousands of people in New York, to whom some
portions of the metropolis are as much of a mystery as Paris,
or Bagdad, or Calcutta, or Cairo in Egypt.</p>

<p>This may seem like a singular statement, yet it is a perfectly
true one.</p>

<p>Along the East River front of the city many sights are to be
seen, which could not but be as surprising as interesting to
those to whom this section of the city is a sealed book.</p>

<p>Here junk-shops flourish in all their glory, side by side with
old iron and old chain shops.</p>

<p>Groggeries of the lowest kind abound, and here is the lair
of the river-pirate.</p>

<p>Sometimes blocks occur on which not a single building is to
be found, save small offices in connection with iron or lumber
yards.</p>

<p>At night no section of New York is more lonesome, or more
inviting to the performance of deeds of darkness.</p>

<p>Just opposite a tumble-down pier, not far from Grand street
ferry, stood, and still stands, a little shanty, built in the rudest
manner, only one story in height.</p>

<p>Into this shanty we wish to convey the reader, at least in
imagination.</p>

<p>There are but three rooms in the shanty, the front one being
about half of the entire floor, and two smaller rooms, answering
as bedrooms, took up the other half.</p>

<p>In the outer or larger room an old acquaintance&mdash;McGinnis&mdash;may
be seen, seated at a deal table, before him a half-emptied
soda-bottle and a glass. The bottle, however, did
not contain soda, but what may well be termed "liquid fire."</p>

<p>"Well, that was a good job," McGinnis was saying to his
wife, who was bustling around to get him something to eat.
"A bully good job, and no mistake. I don't know as I ever
had one before that paid so well for so little trouble."</p>

<p>"That Brown is a foine, liberal gintleman, I'm a-thinkin',"
remarked Mrs. McGinnis, as she turned the slice of ham in
the frying-pan.</p>

<p>"He doesn't throw any money away, ye can depind on
that," McGinnis abruptly rejoined. "Whin he pays me that
sum of money jist to capture the girl, yez can jist bet your life
he's a-goin' to make more money by the operation than he gives
me."</p>

<p>"Ah, McGinnis, you're a sharp one, that's what ye are,"
said his wife, admiringly. "Now, shure, I'd never a-thought
of the likes of that. It's an alderman ye'd ought to be, instead
of what ye are."</p>

<p>"Whist!" interrupted McGinnis, bringing her to a halt.
"Niver mind mentioning me occupation. Walls sometimes
have ears, so they do. But, I say, be lively, old woman, for
the boss is a-comin' to-night to have a look at the gal."</p>

<p>The ham had been discussed, and McGinnis had just lighted
his pipe, when a low knock came at the door.</p>

<p>"That's him!" exclaimed McGinnis, as he started for the
door. "He's on time, jist."</p>

<p>Surely enough, it was the highly respectable-looking lawyer,
who had asked Helen if he had not seen her somewhere before,
and also what her name was.</p>

<p>As the door was opened, he glided in swiftly, and himself
hastily closed the door, and stood by until it was secured.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, as he advanced into the center of the
apartment, rubbing his hands, "well, you were successful?"</p>

<p>"That I was!" with a hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>"This is your wife?"</p>

<p>"It is, sor."</p>

<p>"She can be depended on?"</p>

<p>"Every bit as much as meself, sor. No fear of her&mdash;not a
bit."</p>

<p>"And the girl?"</p>

<p>"Is below," was the reply, as McGinnis pointed downward,
to signify that Helen was somewhere beneath the floor.</p>

<p>"Good! Excellent!" and the rascally lawyer laughed
quietly.</p>

<p>"Would ye be after wantin' to see her?" McGinnis now inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>At a sign from her lord and master, Mrs. McGinnis lighted
a candle, then took a look at the two small windows to see
that the curtains were closely drawn, and then handing the
lighted candle to McGinnis, she bent and raised a trap-door.</p>

<p>This disclosed a dark-looking hole, up from which came a
rush of damp, cold air, which almost chilled the marrow in
the lawyer's bones.</p>

<p>But he must descend, if he wished to see the girl, for it would
hardly be safe to bring her up.</p>

<p>An idea that flashed across his brain just as he was about
to descend caused him to suddenly pause and bend a keen
gaze on the rascally pair.</p>

<p>The life of McGinnis was in his hands.</p>

<p>Suppose the villain should take this opportunity of putting
it forever out of his power to again threaten him?</p>

<p>It was a startling reflection.</p>

<p>Brown had come there secretly; nobody knew of where he
was going, nobody had seen him enter this shanty&mdash;facts concerning
which McGinnis was as well posted as himself.</p>

<p>But in the faces of man and wife no sign of treachery was
to be seen.</p>

<p>He could trust them.</p>

<p>"There is no danger," Brown mentally said. "They will
not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs&mdash;they are too
avaricious for that."</p>

<p>He judged them rightly.</p>

<p>Brown descended into the sort of half-cellar beneath the
house, of so little depth that it was necessary to bend the head
to move about.</p>

<p>"Careful, sor," said McGinnis, who was ahead. "Bad cess
to it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Splash!</p>

<p>"There ye go!" McGinnis went on; "I forgot that the tide
is up, and that the hole was filled with water."</p>

<p>"Deuce take it!" growled Brown. "I'm wet up to my
knees. Does the water rise in here with the tide?"</p>

<p>"It do, sir. In the spring tides the water comes up close
to the flure of the rooms above."</p>

<p>A few steps further, and then the villainous abductor of
Helen Dilt said:</p>

<p>"Here we are, sir!"</p>

<p>They had reached one corner of the cellar, and when McGinnis
held up the light, Brown saw the fair young girl, stretched on
a pallet of straw, which kindness even the cruel McGinnis had
not been able to deny her.</p>

<p>"Is she dead?" asked Brown, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"I think not. She wasn't less than two hours ago when the
old woman brought down some grub to her."</p>

<p>So very still did Helen lie that the lawyer thought she surely
was dead, until having drawn very close it became evident
that she was only sleeping.</p>

<p>Poor Helen!</p>

<p>It was the first time that her eyes had closed in slumber in
the three days which had elapsed since she had been forcibly
brought to this place.</p>

<p>Approached by McGinnis, he had told her some plausible
story, and led her away from the more public thoroughfares,
and then had suddenly turned on her, and putting a revolver
to her head had threatened to kill her did she make any outcry.</p>

<p>He had hurried her into a "ranch" where he was known,
had kept her there until after midnight, and then had forced
her through the deserted streets to his own shanty.</p>

<p>The flashing of the light into her face woke her up.</p>

<p>One moment she seemed confused in mind, and then appeared
to recognize her surroundings.</p>

<p>She did not know, could not guess, why she had been
brought here at the expense of so much trouble and risk, but
she could not but feel certain that it was for the furtherance of
some evil design.</p>

<p>She started to a sitting position and glanced at her visitors.</p>

<p>The light of the candle shone across Brown's face, and before
he could turn and hide his features in shadow she had
recognized him.</p>

<p>"Sir, what have I done to you that you should persecute
me thus?" she asked, in a tone that trembled with a mixture
of indignation and fear. "I know you; you bought a <i>Herald</i>
of me once, and asked my name."</p>

<p>"Curse the luck! I had not intended this," muttered
Brown. "All I wanted was to see the girl and make sure he
had abducted the right one. Well, since you know me, then,
let me ask you a question: <i>What do you know of your early
life?</i>"</p>

<p>For a minute Helen was silent.</p>

<p>Why this peculiar question?</p>

<p>Earnestly she gazed at him, but she could find no clew from
his face, for he kept it in the shadow.</p>

<p>"I know nothing at all of it," she finally answered.</p>

<p>"Positively nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, save that a sad, sweet face seems
sometimes to rise before me, as if seen through a mist. But
it never lasts long, for the mists thicken until it has disappeared
again."</p>

<p>An evil and exultant smile flitted across the lawyer's face.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, and he and McGinnis ascended to the
rooms above, leaving Helen alone in that dark and damp and
dank place&mdash;left her there alone to encounter a terrible ordeal.</p>

<p>It was a time of neap or spring tide, besides which the wind
was in the right direction to make the water rise very high.</p>

<p>Helen slept again. And so heavily that she was not awakened
by the water which crept up around her and saturated
her clothing, until it reached her lips, and partially strangled
her by being drawn in along with a breath.</p>

<p>She started up with a wild shriek.</p>

<p>"Quiet down there!" bellowed the harsh voice of McGinnis,
as he raised the trap-door a little. "Quiet, I say, or I'll keep
my word and murder you if you make any noise."</p>

<p>And Helen was silent, even though so horrified, and stood
there trembling, with lips pallid and heart at almost a standstill,
as the cold and treacherous tide mounted higher and
higher.</p>

<p>It reached her knees, her waist, her arm-pits, and even
here did not stop. Higher still it mounted, until it reached
her pallid lips.</p>

<p class="center">THE REMEMBERED BILLS.</p>


<p>Some few days subsequent to my adventure in the dive I
met a lady on the street, at sight of whose face I gave a
slight start.</p>

<p>I had seen the face somewhere before; in fact, felt that I
had once been quite familiar with it.</p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Morris!" I said.</p>

<p>The lady turned swiftly, not a little startled at being thus
addressed. Then I saw her face light up with a look of recognition.</p>

<p>"I thought I was not mistaken," I said. "You remember
me, I hope?"</p>

<p>"I do. You are Howard, who became a detective after
I last saw you."</p>

<p>"Right," I rejoined, and then I walked along beside her towards
her humble home.</p>

<p>I had not thought of Mat in some days, but at sight of her
he flashed into my mind.</p>

<p>I finally inquired about him.</p>

<p>"I have not see him in some time," Mrs. Morris said, in
reply.</p>

<p>I told her of my having seen him, and then she told me
about Helen.</p>

<p>We reached her humble home.</p>

<p>She then told me that she had heard from Mat, although
she had not seen him. Several mornings before she had
awakened to find an envelope thrust beneath the door, on
opening which she found its contents to be five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars!" I exclaimed, in surprise. "Will
you let me see the money, Mrs. Morris?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>The amount was precisely that which I had paid Shadow.
I remembered some of the bills, and was curious to see if they
were contained in the money.</p>

<p>They were.</p>

<p>Every bill that I had specially noted was in the roll of bills
she handed to me in response to my request.</p>

<p>The last lingering doubt as to Mat Morris and Shadow being
one and the same person was swept from my mind by this
circumstance.</p>

<p>I said nothing, however, to Mrs. Morris of where and how
I had last seen Shadow&mdash;or Mat&mdash;for I knew it could only
make her more anxious on his account.</p>

<p>While wondering where Mat could have obtained so large a
sum of money, the mother's confidence in her son was so great
that she felt it had been come by in none other than a proper
and honest manner.</p>

<p>"Will you not do what you can toward finding our Helen?"
Mrs. Morris asked at parting.</p>

<p>"I will," was the reply; and, indeed, I kept the subject constantly
before me, and my ears always open, when I visited
the many haunts of vice in the pursuit of my duties.</p>

<p>But weeks glided away and I found no clew, nor had I
heard or seen aught of Shadow.</p>

<p>Yet he was not idle, and I now know that though I did not
see him he saw me many times, and avoided me on purpose.</p>

<p>Steadily, although slowly, he pursued the one object of his
present mode of life.</p>

<p>Any man who was known to be "crooked," and who at all
resembled a certain description, he would persistently shadow
until he knew that the person was not guilty of that particular
crime.</p>

<p>Again and again was he disappointed.</p>

<p>But he would only make a dissatisfied gesture with his hand,
and then in thin air write the words:</p>

<p>"Try, try again! Success must come at last!"</p>

<p>And then he would go relentlessly on, pursuing some unknown
person who was even more shadowy than himself.</p>

<p>Besides searching for this one person, Shadow had devoted
himself from a feeling of resentment toward the whole tribe of
evil-doers, to the exposure of villainy whenever and wherever
he found it.</p>

<p>The two burglars whom I had overheard talking about some
"job" on entering the dive, were being cared for by Shadow.</p>

<p>Supposed to be deaf and dumb they had talked freely before
him&mdash;it was destined to be to their sorrow.</p>

<p>They laid their plans for the robbery of a bank with the
most consummate skill.</p>

<p>Having rented a vacant store adjoining the building in
which the bank was located, they opened an oyster saloon, but
rather discouraged than encouraged trade.</p>

<p>With the fall of night they would descend to the cellar, and
until break of day would work at cutting through the foundation
wall.</p>

<p>It was thick and strongly built, but this they had expected,
and were prepared for. Digging out the mortar between the
bricks, first one and then another was pried out, until at last
only one layer of four inches in thickness remained, which a
single blow from the blunt end of a crowbar would knock out.</p>

<p>This was accomplished on Friday night.</p>

<p>They now quit work until the following night, when they intended
entering, knowing that in all probability they would
have until Monday morning to "tap" the vault and safe.</p>

<p>But, safe as they felt themselves, a pair of keen eyes were
upon them.</p>

<p>They were those of Shadow.</p>

<p>Late on Sunday afternoon a note was handed me. It was
from the mysterious being, whom I felt sure was none other
than Mat Morris.</p>

<p>The note was very brief.</p>

<p>It simply said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be at the corner of &mdash;&mdash; street and &mdash;&mdash; avenue at eleven
o'clock to-night, with a dozen men. You must be in citizens'
clothes.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Shadow.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This time I did not hesitate about getting ready to act upon
the communication of the mysterious detective.</p>

<p>Promptly at the hour indicated I was at the designated
spot, while the required number of men were scattered about
in the concealment of various doorways there, and waiting,
but out of sight.</p>

<p>I had not long to wait.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Shadow had arisen out of the ground, for I
had not seen or heard him approach, yet on turning on feeling
my elbow touched, found him at my side.</p>

<p>Holding up his hands between me and the light of the nearest
lamp, so that I could plainly see what he was about, he
asked me in the deaf and dumb alphabet:</p>

<p>"Can you understand this?"</p>

<p>There are few school-boys who have not at some time learned
the art of thus talking with the fingers, and I have once been
able to do almost as well as the mutes who are compelled to
converse in this way.</p>

<p>Making an effort I found that I could recall the alphabet,
and answered:</p>

<p>"I can understand."</p>

<p>"Pretend to be drunk, and follow me. When I cough,
quietly capture the man you will see."</p>

<p>Side by side we reeled up the avenue, and several blocks
away I saw a fellow coming in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"The lookout," I mentally said, and placed my revolver in
a handy position.</p>

<p>I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Just as we were about to pass the fellow, Shadow coughed.
Quick as a flash, I wheeled and planted the muzzle of my
weapon to the lookout's head, sternly saying:</p>

<p>"Not a word&mdash;not a bit of noise&mdash;or I'll put a bullet in your
noddle!"</p>

<p>Surprised completely, the fellow caved, and I ran him along
to where the men were walking, handcuffed him, and sent him
to the station in charge of two men, but not until after Shadow
had gone through his pockets.</p>

<p>We now all followed Shadow.</p>

<p>"Wait here," he finally spelled on his fingers. "In five
minutes, at the farthest, I will return."</p>

<p>From the lookout's pocket he had taken a pass-key, which
admitted him to a hall connecting with the bogus oyster saloon,
and leaving the door unlocked, disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, lengthened into ten, twelve, fifteen, and
still Shadow had not returned.</p>

<p>Had he been detected and murdered?</p>

<p>I could wait no longer. I opened the door and entered,
followed by my men.</p>

<p>We heard stealthy steps, and paused.</p>

<p>Then the slide of a dark lantern was opened by some one,
and in the big strong patch of light it threw we saw Shadow.</p>

<p>There was a rush of feet, the light was covered, and we&mdash;the
silent witnesses&mdash;heard a low cry and a heavy fall.</p>

<p>Had Shadow's boldness cost him his life? I thought of Mrs.
Morris, and my heart was saddened.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A HAPPY MOMENT.</p>


<p>When Shadow left us outside and entered through the door
which he opened by aid of the pass-key taken from the captured
"lookout," he turned aside from the hall, into the store.</p>

<p>As before stated, one marked peculiarity of his was his light
tread, so light that none but a suspicious and very acute ear
could detect it.</p>

<p>From his pocket he took a wax match and lighted it. Before
it had burned so low as to necessitate his blowing it out,
he had gained such additional knowledge as he required,
which was principally that the movable articles in the room
were in the same positions as when he had come here to eat
oysters on several occasions.</p>

<p>The trap-door that had been cut through the floor behind
the counter was open; to its head Shadow softly went.</p>

<p>Noiselessly as a cat he descended the stairs to the cellar,
and there was guided forward by the light that shone through
the breach in the foundation wall.</p>

<p>He soon reached the breach, without having aroused any
suspicion of his proximity, and obtained a hasty although
comprehensive glance into the vault beneath the bank.</p>

<p>The burglars had had easy work, and had already secured
the "swag."</p>

<p>In fact, at that very moment two of their number were engaged
in bringing loads of specie to the breach.</p>

<p>So close were they that Shadow could not retreat without
discovering himself to them.</p>

<p>He shrank back against the wall, and edging away, paused
only when a dozen or fifteen feet from the breach.</p>

<p>Through this the two burglars passed, entering the cellar
beneath the store.</p>

<p>Shadow supposed that after depositing their loads both
would return to the bank building. In this he was mistaken,
for while one returned the other remained for the purpose of
receiving the loads which now began to arrive.</p>

<p>The detective was in a box.</p>

<p>To attempt to retreat now was equivalent to detection: to
remain, he would be spotted the very minute a light was
brought into the cellar. While it was dark, and he even suppressed
his breath, he was safe, but for no greater length of
time.</p>

<p>Shadow at last determined on making an attempt to reach
the stairs and mount them, so as to give us the word.</p>

<p>Holding his breath, he took a step, and then paused.</p>

<p>In a minute he took one more step and paused again.</p>

<p>He had not been heard.</p>

<p>Still another step.</p>

<p>And yet he was undetected.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the bustle at the time of the delivery
of each armful, he would glide along several feet. In this
manner he had nearly reached the foot of the stairs, and so far
as he could judge was unsuspected.</p>

<p>But as yet he had only had play when compared with the
tact required to mount the stairs.</p>

<p>When half way up he overheard whispers. The words he
could not comprehend, but, as he heard no movement toward
the stairs, he thought they did not refer to him.</p>

<p>But they did.</p>

<p>The stairs had cracked and squeaked, notwithstanding his
carefulness in stepping.</p>

<p>And the earth which had softened his footfalls so that they
had not been heard, now performed the same kindly office for
the burglars.</p>

<p>They were edging toward the stairs.</p>

<p>They reached the foot, as Shadow reached the head of them.</p>

<p>Any doubt which the burglars may have had was put to
flight by hearing the sigh of relief which unconsciously fell
from Shadow's lips as he took the last upward step.</p>

<p>At once there was a rush up-stairs by the villainous crew.</p>

<p>So promptly did they accomplish the ascent of the stairs
that Shadow had no time to cross the store floor to the hall.</p>

<p>As already described, the bull's-eye flashed its light on him,
after which there was a grand rush at him, followed by a low
groan and the thud of a falling body.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" I inwardly exclaimed. "Poor Mrs. Morris&mdash;how
her son's death will grieve her."</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was not idle.</p>

<p>My hand had dipped into my pocket, and now held a parlor
match.</p>

<p>"Ready!"</p>

<p>So I lowly said to my men.</p>

<p>Then I suddenly struck the match, glanced around, sprang
to the gas fixture my eye lighted on, turned on the gas, and
in less than five seconds from the time of striking the match,
the scene was lighted by a blazing gas jet.</p>

<p>"Surrender!" I sternly ordered, leveling a brace of revolvers,
before the rascals had ceased to gasp in surprise at the
sudden turn affairs had taken.</p>

<p>Then they turned and made a rush toward the trap-door
behind the bar.</p>

<p>But with equal swiftness I sprang upon the counter, kneeling
in a position to command the entrance to the cellar.</p>

<p>"The first man who tries to escape in that direction gets a
bullet in his noddle!" I grimly told them, and they halted short
in their stampede, and dumbly looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Close in, boys!"</p>

<p>This to my men.</p>

<p>"Now then, my hearties, you're fairly cornered, and the
wisest thing for you to do is to cave."</p>

<p>"Don't give in, lads!" yelled a gruff voice. "We're almost
as many as they are, and a good bold stroke will carry us out."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the desperate men made a wild, although
irresolute and wavering charge.</p>

<p>"Stand firm!" I yelled to my men, and then aimed at the
leader of the gang.</p>

<p>He had cocked his revolver, was aiming at my head with
deadly intent.</p>

<p>It was my life or his, and I pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>With a single groan, he sank to the floor, with a bullet in
his brain.</p>

<p>"Close in now! And shoot every man who offers resistance!"</p>

<p>The men did as directed.</p>

<p>The charge had been only half-hearted anyhow, and the fall
of their leader completely demoralized the remainder, and
dropping their weapons, they flung up their hands in token of
surrender.</p>

<p>In less than two minutes we had them all handcuffed.</p>

<p>When I had heard the last pair of bracelets click, I put
up my revolver, but not before; and then I wiped the perspiration
from my forehead.</p>

<p>It is singular how quickly a man begins to perspire in moments
of excitement like this through which I had passed, but
perspire he always does, and freely at that.</p>

<p>I had caught a glimpse of a body stretched on the floor at
the farther side of the room from where I was perched on the
counter.</p>

<p>"Poor Mat! Poor Shadow!"</p>

<p>So I muttered as I made my way toward the body. It laid
just where I had last seen Shadow standing, in the full glare
of the light from the bull's-eye lantern.</p>

<p>I reached the body, and&mdash;<i>it was not that of Shadow!</i></p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes. No, it was not Shadow. I arose to my
feet and glanced about the room. But naught was to be seen
of the lithe figure of the mysterious detective.</p>

<p>Nobody had seen him go out by way of the hall. Then, I
thought, he must have descended to the cellar.</p>

<p>But when we went down-stairs, we could find no trace of
him there.</p>

<p>He had disappeared.</p>

<p>But how, or where to, not the wisest one of us could say.</p>

<p>Neither could I imagine how he had escaped with his life,
when they made that wild rush at him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A NARROW ESCAPE.</p>


<p>Afraid to incur the anger of McGinnis, Helen made no
further outcry after receiving his harsh command to be silent,
but stood there, trembling with horror, as the treacherous
waters continued to rise.</p>

<p>Tiny waves were rippling the surface of the water, and one
of these at last sprang against her lips.</p>

<p>Panting, worn out, Helen felt like permitting herself to
sink, and thus quickly end the horrors of her situation.</p>

<p>But the ripple receded, and she was again able to breathe.</p>

<p>She did not wish to die.</p>

<p>Above all, she did not wish to meet such an awful death as
this.</p>

<p>She pictured her dead body floating in the water or stretched
in the mud of the floor, and her frame was convulsed by
swift-flying thrills of horror.</p>

<p>This mental picture nearly crazed Helen.</p>

<p>"No, no," she moaned. "No, no, I cannot, I will not, die
in this terrible manner."</p>

<p>She beat the water with her hands, and clutched at it, and
tried to push it back.</p>

<p>Slowly but softly the water continued to rise, and she could
lift her head no higher, for it was even then against the under
side of the floor above her.</p>

<p>The water was at her lips now&mdash;not a ripple, but the whole
body was on a level with them.</p>

<p>She closed her lips, but a minute later it filled her nostrils
when she breathed.</p>

<p>Out of her very desperation was now born a singular calmness
and self-possession.</p>

<p>She was now able to think and reason as she could not have
done before.</p>

<p>It is singular but true that in the face of death many people,
in times of lesser danger absolute cowards, become brave
and calm as any one can be.</p>

<p>So it was with Helen.</p>

<p>Whether or not she was to be drowned like a rat she did
not know.</p>

<p>But she did know that her situation was a precarious one.</p>

<p>Calm now as she was, she was not long in striking on the
only means whereby she could preserve her life a little longer,
perhaps for a long time longer.</p>

<p>Throwing her head backward, she let it rest against one of
the floor-beams, and thrust her face upward close to the floor.</p>

<p>She could now breathe again.</p>

<p>But she had played her last card, so to speak, and did the
water rise another three inches her fate was unalterably
sealed.</p>

<p>The position she had assumed was an uncomfortable one,
but she did not allow her resolution to waver even though the
tide continued to creep higher and higher, although not so
rapidly as before.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;what a fervent prayer of thanks Helen uttered&mdash;at
last she knew that the water had ceased to rise.</p>

<p>And then presently it began slowly falling.</p>

<p>At the expiration of a quarter of an hour she was able to
move her head from the unnatural position in which she had
placed it.</p>

<p>Lower and lower the water now went, in just the same regular,
even pace with which it had arisen in the cellar.</p>

<p>Lower and lower&mdash;lower and lower&mdash;until Helen sank on
her knees, her head remaining above the surface, and then she
prayed as perhaps she had never prayed before.</p>

<p>As she was thus engaged she heard a heavy tread on the
floor over her head.</p>

<p>McGinnis had just come in.</p>

<p>And he came with haste, for he had just heard of the remarkably
high tide, and feared that his prisoner had fallen a
victim to its cold embrace.</p>

<p>He now understood the meaning of Helen's cries, and their
not having been repeated under such circumstances, he considered
as indicating her death.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;I say, down there!" he yelled. "Are you alive
and kicking?"</p>

<p>Helen had nothing to gain by keeping silence, and as she
arose from her knees, she replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" grunted her jailer, banging shut the trap-door.</p>

<p>When he afterwards brought Helen down something to eat,
and saw the height to which the water had risen, he gazed at
her in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>He could not understand how it was that she had preserved
her life.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" he exclaimed. "How did you do it, gal?
Why, there wasn't more'n an inch of space left between the
water and the floor."</p>

<p>"I did it, though, with His assistance," said Helen, reverently.</p>

<p>"Whose assistance?" and McGinnis glared about him, as
he asked the question, in an alarmed tone.</p>

<p>"His!" and Helen pointed upward as she uttered the one
word in a solemn tone.</p>

<p>"Oh!" in a relieved tone, and the villain then laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>He stayed by Helen while she was eating, and his evil eyes
were lighted with admiration as they rested on her.</p>

<p>"I say," he remarked, when she had finished eating&mdash;"I
say, you're a trump, even though you be such a young gal."</p>

<p>Helen's puzzled look was evidence that she did not comprehend
at what he was driving.</p>

<p>"You're a smart one, too," said McGinnis. "And I think
it's blamed tough on you to pen you in here."</p>

<p>"Then why did you do so?" demanded Helen.</p>

<p>"Orders, my sweet, orders&mdash;and orders must be obeyed.
But, I say, how'd you like to take the place of the old woman
up-stairs? You're a piece of good stuff, you are, and with a
little edication, could take the shine out of any crooked woman
I ever seen. As for the old crow up-stairs, jist say the word,
and I'll put her out of the way, after which, orders or no orders,
I'll take you outer this place."</p>

<p>The young girl was completely taken aback by this offer of
McGinnis to make her his wife, after murdering the one he
now possessed.</p>

<p>She was unable to say a word.</p>

<p>McGinnis construed her silence in another way, and advancing,
would have kissed Helen, had not she retreated, holding
up her hands to ward him off, her face expressive of horror
and deep disgust.</p>

<p>He pursued her.</p>

<p>Helen faced him, her back to the wall.</p>

<p>"Keep away&mdash;leave me alone," she cried. "Keep away,
or I will shriek until somebody hears me."</p>

<p>Her tone was a determined one, and McGinnis was shrewd
enough to see that it would be foolish to bother her any
farther, or her cries might be heard, and be the means of getting
him into serious trouble.</p>

<p>He backed away, and, with an oath on his lips, went up-stairs,
banging shut the trap-door behind him.</p>

<p>A number of times he brought her meals down to her, but
never again attempted to renew his suit.</p>

<p>Then one night Joseph Brown paid him another visit, and
they held a long conference together.</p>

<p>It was about Helen.</p>

<p>In the dead of night, not long after that, Helen was brought
up from the damp and noisome place.</p>

<p>Some clothing was flung to her, which she was compelled to
attire herself in while guarded by Mrs. McGinnis.</p>

<p>After being led several blocks away she was forced to enter
a carriage, which was then rapidly driven away.</p>

<p>"Where am I being taken to?" asked Helen, in a tone that
trembled as much as her body.</p>

<p>She felt that there were greater dangers to dread in this
midnight ride than if she had remained in the cellar.</p>

<p>McGinnis only laughed delightedly for reply.</p>

<p>"I demand of you to tell me where I am being taken," and
the girl spoke now more firmly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you&mdash;ha-ha-ha! let me whisper," and bending forward
the villain whispered a few words into her ear&mdash;words
that caused the color to desert her face, that caused her to
clasp her hands together, and to sink moaning into her corner
of the conveyance.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN THE BLACK HOLE.</p>


<p>Where had Shadow gone to?</p>

<p>At the instant that the murderous crew rushed at him, he
quietly sank to the floor.</p>

<p>The first one to reach the spot where he had been standing
struck his body.</p>

<p>The cry of surprise on his lips was changed into a death-groan,
as the man nearest him grabbed at and stabbed him,
under the impression that it was the strange, and to them, unknown
person whom they had detected spying on them.</p>

<p>Shadow had seen us and knew that we would now take care
of the gang, and he had edged toward the door communicating
with the hall, and had disappeared unseen by my
men, deeply interested just then in another quarter.</p>

<p>The villains were marched away and locked up, and to make
a long story short were properly punished in due course of
time.</p>

<p>The bank officials, grateful at having been saved a heavy
loss, voted me a handsome sum in reward for my services.</p>

<p>This, I felt, belonged entirely to Shadow, and I kept it
about me in the shape of a check, to be given him at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>From the fact that he had not been found anywhere around,
I was assured that he had escaped, although the manner of it
was then a mystery to me.</p>

<p>And I fully expected to hear something from or see him
within a very few days.</p>

<p>But I did not.</p>

<p>He seemed to have disappeared from the face of earth.</p>

<p>I went around among the dens of the east side, but could
neither see nor learn anything of him.</p>

<p>Again and again I made the tour of the dives, but always
with the same result.</p>

<p>Then, put to work on a case, I plunged into it, became interested,
and Shadow slowly faded from my mind.</p>

<p>It was a murder case.</p>

<p>The murder had been committed under peculiar circumstances,
and I had not been long at work before I became convinced
that it had been done by the hands of a regularly organized
gang of evil-doers.</p>

<p>At last I struck a clew.</p>

<p>I became convinced that I knew the very individual who
had committed the bloody deed, but I delayed arresting him,
as by this time I had gained an inkling of greater work to be
done at the same time.</p>

<p>I was ambitious of entrapping the whole gang, instead of
this solitary member of it.</p>

<p>I laid my plans accordingly.</p>

<p>Disguise was always a forte of mine, and I proceeded now
to conceal my identity as thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p>My next step was to ingratiate myself with a member of the
gang.</p>

<p>I picked my man, and proved an apt student of human nature
when I did so, for perhaps of all the gang he was the only
one who could have been so easily gulled.</p>

<p>His confidence gained, I knew the rest would be easy
enough.</p>

<p>By him I was made acquainted with several others belonging
to the same gang, and on his guarantee of my trustworthiness,
they talked freely before me.</p>

<p>One day Shadow was brought forcibly to my mind by a
chance remark dropped by one of my new friends.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the young chap we've got in the Black
Hole?"</p>

<p>This was the remark.</p>

<p>Could they mean Shadow?</p>

<p>At once I pricked up my ears.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply. "I want to see him, though. What
does he look like?"</p>

<p>"A young fellow with a smooth face, not more than eighteen,
and slender as a girl."</p>

<p>It tallied with Shadow's appearance.</p>

<p>"None know him?"</p>

<p>"So it seems; leastways, none as has seen him yet ever saw
him before. We had Dick Stanton come in and take a peep
at him, and Dick says he ain't a detective&mdash;that is, a regular
detective, at any rate."</p>

<p>"He was caught nosing around, though?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Had he tumbled to anything much?"</p>

<p>"That we don't know, for he won't say a word&mdash;aye, yes
or no."</p>

<p>"And what does the cap'n mean to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I give it up. One of the boys told me that in the end he
meant to have him knifed."</p>

<p>"The best thing to do. 'Dead men tell no tales,'" remarked
the other.</p>

<p>Here they let the thing drop.</p>

<p>I wanted to find out where this Black Hole was, but dared
ask no questions, nor press the subject of the young fellow's
captivity.</p>

<p>For the present I was compelled to adopt a waiting policy,
or run the risk of killing the confidence I had already gained,
by the asking of too many questions.</p>

<p>Still, it was a horrible thought to me that, while I was doing
nothing, Shadow (otherwise Mat Morris) was in captivity
in the Black Hole, a place whose name implied nothing but
the horrible, and in hourly danger of being butchered like an
animal.</p>

<p>In this dilemma I changed my disguise and took to tracking
these men to find out where their head-quarters were, presuming
that it would be there where the Black Hole would be
found.</p>

<p>I tracked them finally to an old and ruined brick building
near the East River.</p>

<p>It had once been a sugar-house, but had burned out, leaving
only its walls standing.</p>

<p>The remains of the building had been turned to advantage&mdash;its
walls squared on top and roofed over, leaving a structure
in some places one story high, in other places two stories.</p>

<p>It was for the most part occupied by old junk and chain
men, and among them were several well-known to the police,
and suspected of being receiving shops for the "swag" of the
river pirates.</p>

<p>Was the Black Hole only one of the vaults of the old sugar-house?</p>

<p>Was it located here?</p>

<p>I would have given a thousand dollars to have been sure of
this.</p>

<p>In the dead of night I again drew near this old sugar-house,
and stretched myself out alongside of a big piece of dock timber
that chanced to lie in a good position.</p>

<p>About two o'clock I heard footsteps approaching from the
direction of the river, and when the persons drew nearer I recognized
one voice as that of the individual whom I had thus
far bamboozled.</p>

<p>The scent was getting "hot."</p>

<p>They were carrying several heavy coils of rope, the result
of their depredations on the river during a few preceding
hours.</p>

<p>They passed me and approached the building, and I heard
one of them whistle twice, very softly.</p>

<p>Then a peculiar knock was given on a particular door, which
at once promptly opened to give them ingress.</p>

<p>At once a desperate scheme flashed across my brain.</p>

<p>I wanted to save Shadow, but still I did not wish to make
a descent on the place with a body of officers, as it would make
it impossible for me to carry out my original plan of bagging
the whole gang.</p>

<p>I had heard mentioned the name of Dick Stanton. He was
a detective, and, as I now knew, a false one, through whom
had leaked out the intentions of the police on several occasions,
rendering well-laid plans fruitless; so that the police had found
empty nests when they expected a bag full of game.</p>

<p>I arose and went forward.</p>

<p>I whistled thrice, and knocked at the door as I had heard
the others knock.</p>

<p>As the door opened I glided in.</p>

<p>The guard spotted me as a stranger at once, and laid his
hand on his revolver.</p>

<p>"I am sent by Stanton," I promptly said. "He gave me
the points, and told me to carry a message of warning to
'cap.'"</p>

<p>Closing the door, the guard conducted me into a large room,
where was gathered an immense quantity of old junk and rigging
of all descriptions.</p>

<p>"Cap!" he called.</p>

<p>"Yes," came from the distant side of the room, where a lot
of men were gathered about a lantern.</p>

<p>"Somebody to see you," with which the guard went back to
the door, leaving his lantern beside me.</p>

<p>A slight noise caused me to look around, and I was startled
at seeing a human hand protruding up through a crevice in
a junk pile. The hand held a bit of paper, at which I blankly
stared, thinking it held by a dead hand.</p>

<p>But no&mdash;the fingers stirred, the note was shaken. It was
clear that it was intended for me.</p>

<p>I took it.</p>

<p>Cap had not yet started toward me. I read the few words
on the note by the aid of the guard's lantern.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fly! Although the guard does not know&mdash;Stanton is
here! Your first word will betray you.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Shadow.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here was a fix.</p>

<p>How could I pass the guard on the portal? Yet I must go.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="center">FAVORING FORTUNE.</p>


<p>In the course of my professional career I have been in
many tight places, and among the tightest I count that night,
when in the old sugar-house, converted into a "fence" for receiving
the "swag" brought in by the river pirates.</p>

<p>Immediately on reading the note written by Shadow I commenced
retreating, even while Cap was coming forward to see
who wanted him, and what for.</p>

<p>I had pretended to have been sent with a message by Dick
Stanton, who, as Shadow had informed me, was already there,
a fact unknown to the guard, else I must have been roughly
used before this.</p>

<p>To have told this to Cap would have at once betrayed me,
and my heart swelled with gratitude to Shadow&mdash;for I considered
that he had saved my life.</p>

<p>Did misfortune attend my efforts to pass the guard, it would
not be Shadow's fault, but my own in venturing into this
place.</p>

<p>And yet I had done so on his account, had done so because
I had learned that a young fellow answering his description
was kept close prisoner in a place significantly called the
"Black Hole."</p>

<p>Toward the guarded portal I went as rapidly as I could
without an appearance of noisy haste.</p>

<p>I reached it at last.</p>

<p>Cap had not yet reached the spot where he expected to see
me.</p>

<p>I had now just as long to fool the guard as it would take
Cap to grow impatient at not seeing me, and bellow out some
question as to where I was.</p>

<p>"Here's your lantern, my friend, and I'm much obliged for
it," I said, as I drew near the guarded portal.</p>

<p>"See him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Cap's in one of his black humors to-night."</p>

<p>"Phew! I should say so."</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong, was there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular," I answered. "What's the matter
with that bolt? Does it stick?"</p>

<p>"Like thunderation. There it goes. I've got it now.
Now for another one&mdash;you see we keep this place well guarded&mdash;now
another, and all that now remains is to turn the knob."</p>

<p>"Suppose you do it, then, as I've got one or two messages
more to deliver yet."</p>

<p>"Kerect."</p>

<p>The guard's hand was on the knob.</p>

<p>He was in the act of turning it when he suddenly paused.</p>

<p>"Got the pass?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The pass."</p>

<p>"What pass?"</p>

<p>"Why, every night the cap'n gives out a new pass, and
none go through this door without giving it."</p>

<p>"He must have forgotten to give it to me," I returned,
clenching my fists unseen by the guard. "It's all right,
though, so let me out, as I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Can't help it. Hurry or no hurry, you can't get through
here until the cap'n gives me orders to let you, or you give me
the password."</p>

<p>I set my teeth.</p>

<p>With liberty before me I was not going to be balked in this
way.</p>

<p>"Let me out!" I ordered.</p>

<p>"I can't do it."</p>

<p>"Let me out, I say."</p>

<p>"I dare not, and I won't 'thout the cap'n's orders. So you
might's well be easy."</p>

<p>From the interior of the densely dark place I now heard an
angry oath.</p>

<p>"I say, where are you?" cap was impatiently asking.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose.</p>

<p>"Growler!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" returned the guard.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say somebody was here to see me?"</p>

<p>Growler turned on me a glance filled with mistrust, and
making a dive, tried to shoot several bolts.</p>

<p>Now was my last and only chance.</p>

<p>I raised my clenched fist.</p>

<p>Spat!</p>

<p>It took him squarely between the eyes, and felled him to the
ground like a log.</p>

<p>"A spy&mdash;a spy!" he yelled, as he was falling.</p>

<p>Cap heard the cry.</p>

<p>Toward the door he came flying, drawing his revolver on
the way.</p>

<p>But I was not slow in taking advantage of my opportunity,
and seizing and turning the knob, I flung open the door and
bounded out into the darkness.</p>

<p>Fearing pursuit, and knowing myself to be in a mighty hard
neighborhood, where every man I might chance to meet would
be more likely friends of the pirates than friends of mine, I
dashed around the old building and flung myself down in a
place of hiding.</p>

<p>I heard a door open on that side of the building, only a few
seconds later.</p>

<p>The person who emerged was Dick Stanton, the false detective.</p>

<p>I recognized him by a peculiar snuffle that had long been a
settled habit of his.</p>

<p>Quick to think and act, I sprang to my feet, and dropping
all fears of pursuit, followed him.</p>

<p>When he had got into a section of the city where there was
no chance of his being rescued by the pirates, I hastened my
pace and finally reached his side.</p>

<p>"How are you, Dick?"</p>

<p>He gave a start as I called him by name, and turning swiftly,
glanced keenly at me, pausing beneath a street lamp that he
might see me better.</p>

<p>"Is my disguise so good, then?" I asked, with a laugh,
speaking in my natural tone.</p>

<p>"Howard!"</p>

<p>"Correct."</p>

<p>"Your disguise is perfect."</p>

<p>"Would my own mother know me?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. How in the world do you manage to get
yourself up so thoroughly?"</p>

<p>"It's a knack of mine. I say, Dick, got anything on
hand?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Lend me your revolvers, then, will you? Mine I forgot
when I left the house."</p>

<p>"Did you? That's funny, for I forgot mine also. I haven't
got so good a weapon about me as a jack-knife."</p>

<p>"Then," and I spoke very sternly, and quickly drawing a
revolver, placed it to his temple, "then consider yourself my
prisoner."</p>

<p>"Wh-what do you mean?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I'll show you."</p>

<p>"This must be a joke of yours," said the trembling wretch.</p>

<p>"It will be a sorry joke for you," said I. "Hold out your
hands."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Hold 'em out."</p>

<p>I pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver against his temple
a little harder.</p>

<p>He understood the significance of the movement, and loathfully
put out his hands.</p>

<p>"Howard, I don't like this," he said, in an assumed angry
tone, to carry out the idea that he considered it in the light
of a practical joke.</p>

<p>"You'll like it less before I get through with you," as I
snapped the handcuffs on his wrists. "To be a thief is bad
enough, but to call yourself a detective and then be in league
with a gang of cut-throats, river-pirates and burglars, is far
worse, and I give you my word that I intend to shove you as
hard as I can."</p>

<p>Stanton's jaw fell.</p>

<p>He was cornered and confounded.</p>

<p>"Lost!" he groaned.</p>

<p>And then, with bent head, he walked dumbly along at my
side.</p>

<p>"Howard, will you not let up on me?" he pleaded, humbly,
his tone trembling with fear.</p>

<p>"What will I gain by it?" I artfully said.</p>

<p>"Why, they always let the one go who turns State's evidence,"
he said, eagerly. "Give me a chance, won't you?"</p>

<p>How disgusted I was with Stanton!</p>

<p>A traitor to the force, he was no sooner found out than he
was ready to turn traitor to his pals.</p>

<p>"I'll promise you nothing," I coldly returned. "You can
tell me what you please, and if I then think your information
worthy of mercy to you, you shall have it."</p>

<p>"You always were a good fellow," he said, fawningly, "and
I'll trust you."</p>

<p>"You must do exactly as I say."</p>

<p>"I will," he promptly answered.</p>

<p>An idea had occurred to me.</p>

<p>It was, instead of taking Stanton to the police station&mdash;where
I would have been obliged to enter a specific charge
against him&mdash;to take him to a secret place of confinement,
and there keep him until I had bagged the river-pirates, penetrated
to the Black Hole, and bursted up the villainous den.</p>

<p>To reach the place I had in my mind's eye, it was necessary
to retrace some of our steps, and we once again entered the
rough precincts right along the East River.</p>

<p>As Stanton had been treacherous to the force of which he
was a member, was willing to be treacherous toward his pals,
so, now, in keeping with his character, he acted treacherously
toward me.</p>

<p>While passing a low drinking place&mdash;"boozing ken" was
its popular name in that locality&mdash;he suddenly pursed up his
lips and whistled sharply in a peculiar way, repeated a given
number of times.</p>

<p>I knew he intended it for a signal.</p>

<p>I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Within half a minute a little squad of men dashed out of the
"boozing ken" to rescue him who had given this signal.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN THE MAD-HOUSE.</p>


<p>What were those whispered words of McGinnis' which so
affected Helen Dilt?</p>

<p>Let them be what they might, there could be no doubt that
they struck terror to her soul.</p>

<p>She sank back in the corner of the conveyance, and audibly
moaned.</p>

<p>Poor girl!</p>

<p>She was a heroine in her way, and could have borne a great
deal were it to advance some good cause, or because she
merited it.</p>

<p>But to be compelled to endure untold horrors, why and
wherefore she knew not, was terrible.</p>

<p>"Why am I persecuted?"</p>

<p>So she asked McGinnis a little later, appealingly, in a wavering
voice.</p>

<p>"Can't tell you&mdash;don't know."</p>

<p>"You are employed by that monster whom I saw in that
cellar?"</p>

<p>"I am. There's no good denying that."</p>

<p>"Has he no heart? Have you no heart, that you conspire
with him to persecute a friendless girl?"</p>

<p>"I gets paid for it."</p>

<p>So McGinnis dryly replied.</p>

<p>"Paid for it? Then you lack conscience as well as heart.
I beg of you, do not do this horrible thing. Release me, restore
me to my friends, and I will pray for you as long as I
live."</p>

<p>"Pray for me? Ha-ha!" laughed McGinnis. "That's a good
one!"</p>

<p>Helen moaned bitterly.</p>

<p>Nothing could move the villain except money, and that
Helen did not have.</p>

<p>McGinnis watched her for some time in silence, a gloating
expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>He had something in his mind, and presently it came out.</p>

<p>"There is one way," he said to Helen, "to escape this
thing which you appear not to hanker after very much.</p>

<p>"And that?" she exclaimed eagerly.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?"</p>

<p>As he asked the question he leered at her in a meaning
way.</p>

<p>The girl's heart sank.</p>

<p>She knew at once what he meant.</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>Helen made no reply, only shuddered and shrank away from
the villain besides her.</p>

<p>"It's your last chance," urged McGinnis. "And you'll not
get another, I kin tell ye. Once them doors close behind your
back you're done for. Got any answer for me?"</p>

<p>"Mercy!" gasped Helen. "Anything but that. Pity me&mdash;spare
me&mdash;do not stain your soul with a crime so dreadful
as this."</p>

<p>"Yes or no, plain," growled McGinnis. "Come now,
speak up right sharp and don't waste any time in palavering.
Yes or no? And remember, it's your last chance. Say 'yes,'
and yer gits McGinnis for a husband, McGinnis as is known
to be one of the sharpest and best men on a 'lay' in the
country. Say 'no,' and you're done for. Into the mad-house
you'll go, never to come out until you're carried out, feet first."</p>

<p>She could never marry him, after he had imbrued his hands
in the blood of the woman he now called his wife. She could
never have married him anyhow. Better the mad-house, better
death itself, than that.</p>

<p>There was nothing gained by attempting to fool him. Suppose
she did say 'yes,' and by means of it staved off incarceration
in the mad-house for several days, what would it amount
to in the end? Nothing. Had there been any reason for her
to expect a rescue, she might have tried on the game. But
she knew of no efforts being made to find her.</p>

<p>Then a shudder convulsed her frame.</p>

<p>"Yes," she could not say, now that a new thought came to
her, even though she knew it would lead to her rescue before
such time as McGinnis claimed the fulfillment of her pledge.</p>

<p>The little word "yes" would be the death-warrant of a living
human being&mdash;no matter how fallen and wicked, a human
being all the same.</p>

<p>To say "yes" would seal the fate of the woman McGinnis
now called his wife.</p>

<p>Poor Helen!</p>

<p>She bent her head and hid her face in her hands, and wept
bitterly as the closed carriage rolled swiftly onward.</p>

<p>A strange fancy, a love for Helen had taken root in the evil
heart of McGinnis.</p>

<p>That it possessed depth was evidenced by his being willing
to brave the wrath of the man in whose hands his life rested,
provided Helen would become his wife.</p>

<p>"It will be 'yes,' won't it, deary?"</p>

<p>His tone was softer, more affectionate, more tender than we
could have expected from such a man.</p>

<p>He had leaned over toward Helen, and as he asked the
question, he placed one arm about her.</p>

<p>With a shiver she sprang to her feet, wrenching herself
from his grasp, and then she cried:</p>

<p>"No, no! I would sooner die than marry you! Help&mdash;<i>help</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">HELP</span>!
Oh, Heaven! is there no one to help me?"</p>

<p>Like lightning came a change in McGinnis' tone and demeanor.</p>

<p>"Silence!" he hoarsely and angrily hissed. "Silence, I
say! Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Help!" shrieked Helen.</p>

<p>"Silence!" and now the villain threw both arms about her
to pull her down.</p>

<p>"Help!"</p>

<p>McGinnis wasted no more breath in senseless orders.</p>

<p>Down beside him he dragged the girl.</p>

<p>Bravely Helen battled, but her strength was insufficient to
maintain the struggle long.</p>

<p>He seized her by the throat, and tightened his grasp on it.</p>

<p>She gasped for breath.</p>

<p>Her brain reeled.</p>

<p>Consciousness finally fled.</p>

<p>McGinnis now glanced from the carriage window. The
driver perfectly understood his business, and at the instant of
Helen's first cry had commenced winding a tortuous course
through the crooked streets.</p>

<p>His prompt action prevented Helen's cries procuring for her
the help for which she had shrieked.</p>

<p>"Get there as quick as you can," McGinnis told the driver,
and then sat there and watched Helen until the carriage rolled
up and paused before the gate of a private insane asylum.</p>

<p>Into this she was carried in her unconscious condition, the
carriage departing as soon as she was removed from it.</p>

<p>To the sour-visaged dame who was encountered in the hall
McGinnis handed a note.</p>

<p>"Brown, eh?" as she read it. "Well, the poor dear's room
is ready. Right this way with her."</p>

<p>When she had been deposited on a bed McGinnis took his
departure.</p>

<p>At the door he paused for a last glance at the pale face of
Helen.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" he muttered. "It's too bad. Such a plucky
critter ought to a been married to a good feller like me, who
could make somethin' outen her."</p>

<p>An hour later Helen recovered her senses with a wild start.</p>

<p>Opening her eyes she saw an evil-faced hag above her, who
laughed, held up a big bloody pin, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Pins is better'n water to bring a pusson outen a fainting
fit."</p>

<p>Helen tried to move.</p>

<p>She found on doing so that her feet and hands were secured
by stout cords to the four corners of the bedstead.</p>

<p>"Now, my gal," said her tormentor, "how is it agoin' to

give me a heap of trouble? There," jabbing the pin into
Helen, "how do you like that? That's what I allers does when
my patients is bad."</p>

<p>Poor Helen!</p>

<p>A terrible fate opened before her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SHADOW.</p>


<p>A keen pair of eyes scanned the faces of a party of men, all
of them criminals of the worst class.</p>

<p>Those eyes belonged to Shadow.</p>

<p>On one man in the group his eyes rested long and earnestly,
although covertly.</p>

<p>"He's just about the build," Shadow mentally said. "And
he tallies with the description."</p>

<p>With what description?</p>

<p>We shall see in due course of time.</p>

<p>"Shall I dog him?" thought Shadow, and then his eyes
sought the floor and remained fastened there in a reflective
way for some minutes.</p>

<p>The result of his reflections was apparent when, the man
having left the saloon, Shadow followed him.</p>

<p>"I have been disappointed a dozen times," Shadow told
himself, and then sighed. "If I am disappointed again it can
make but little difference, for in the end I shall take a fitting
revenge for that great wrong."</p>

<p>And Woglom, river-pirate, murderer, burglar, anything so
long as it paid him well enough, was from that minute under
the surveillance of as keen a pair of eyes as were ever set in
human head.</p>

<p>The villain was one of the gang connected with the old
sugar-house, and thither Shadow had tracked him.</p>

<p>The mysterious detective determined to secretly gain access
to the place, though that would have been a task to appall the
heart of the stoutest detective on the force.</p>

<p>But he accomplished it.</p>

<p>Having gained access to one of the shops in another part of
the building, he at once turned his attention to the vaults.</p>

<p>Once these had connected from one end of the building to
the other.</p>

<p>Some of the arched communicating doorways had been
closed up by wooden barriers.</p>

<p>These Shadow found means to get the better of, and passing
through, would replace the boards he loosened, so that
they bore no signs of having been tampered with.</p>

<p>At last he gained access to the vault beneath the portion of
the building used as a "fence."</p>

<p>It was not a hard job now for him to get up-stairs.</p>

<p>He had only to wait his chance, and then quietly slide up the
stairs communicating with the store-room above.</p>

<p>Once this was performed without being observed, he found
no difficulty in concealing himself in the piles of old junk and
goods of all descriptions with which the place was filled.</p>

<p>There were times when the place was left without a single
occupant.</p>

<p>These occasions were few, but Shadow did not fail to take
advantage of them, and by moving various articles a little to
this side or that, he constructed a little avenue or passage
under the miscellaneous truck and plunder.</p>

<p>On his hands and knees he used this passage, and he was in
it when he heard the writer of these lines speaking to the
guard, and saying that he was sent by Dick Stanton.</p>

<p>Hastily tearing a leaf from a blank-book, he had written the
note, as well as he was able in the darkness, and had thrust
up the hand containing it through one of the interstices in the
big pile.</p>

<p>Anxiously he laid there, awaiting the result of that almost
foolish venturing of my head into the lion's jaws.</p>

<p>A sigh of relief escaped his lips as he heard the thud caused
by Growler's fall, followed by the deep-chested oaths of Cap,
who, in his rage, turned his revolver on the guard, and was
within an ace of pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>Cap took it for granted that the spy was a detective, and
supposed that the game was up; that the place would surely
be in the hands of the police in an hour or two.</p>

<p>"Lock that door, and keep it locked!" he savagely ordered
Growler, and then started on a run for the other side of the
building, hoping to catch Stanton.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, the latter had taken his departure, to
be nabbed a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Hastily Cap got his portable valuables together, and prepared
for flight at a moment's notice from the scouts sent out
in all directions.</p>

<p>No alarm came in.</p>

<p>Hours passed, daylight broke, and still they had not been
molested.</p>

<p>A message was privately sent to Stanton, asking him to
ferret out the true meaning of the strange visit, as well as who
the visitor was.</p>

<p>Cap moved his money and valuables to a place of safety, and
then sat down, assuming an air of injured innocence to fool the
police with in case they came.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Shadow was busy.</p>

<p>Off in one corner was a sort of room made by piling up
boxes and rubbish. This Cap used as an office, and here he
took those with whom he wished to confer privately.</p>

<p>Having learned this, Shadow had determined to extend the
passage right up to the office, so that he could overhear what
passed within.</p>

<p>Sometimes a natural crevice was made large enough for
him to crawl through by a little exertion of strength, and the
thing could be done without producing any noise whatever.</p>

<p>Like a mole beneath the surface he worked his way on toward
the goal, knowing full well that I would not put my
knowledge into use, now that I knew he was on the ground
with some object in view.</p>

<p>Singular, was it not, that we should have so much confidence
in each other?</p>

<p>Still we had.</p>

<p>Little by little Cap's confidence began to return, and he was
quite himself again when a note came from Dick Stanton.</p>

<p>At least it was signed with Stanton's name.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cap, everything's O. K. I gave a <i>true blue</i> a message for
you a couple of nights ago, about the same matter of which I
spoke to you.</p>

<p>"He didn't try to deliver it until the following night, the
same when I was there. After getting inside he got scared
and forced his way out by knocking down Growler. Don't
worry at all over the affair, for I know what I am talking
about. He's a good fellow, no coward, and once he is given
a show will do some good work."</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Dick Stanton</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The explanation was satisfactory to Cap, although he
thought it a little singular that the note should be shoved under
the door, instead of delivered personally.</p>

<p>The scouts were called in.</p>

<p>Work was resumed; in other words, Cap's gang again began
pillaging on the river and around the harbor.</p>

<p>And Cap had confidential talks with his men in the office.</p>

<p>As silently as the mole, which we have just likened Shadow
to, he made his way toward the office, until, at last, he drew
so near as to be able to distinguish any ordinary toned conversation.</p>

<p>Still closer he wished to go.</p>

<p>"I must get near enough to overhear a whisper," he told
himself. "Out of his own mouth must the monster I am after
convict himself."</p>

<p>And closer he got.</p>

<p>And then his steady successes were offset by a disaster that
caused even his face to blanch.</p>

<p>The stuff he moved settled and closed up the passage behind
him, hemmed him into a little space of two feet by six and
high enough for him to kneel in, and here he must stay until
released, for the stuff just there was too heavy for him to even
budge.</p>

<p>He must reveal himself or starve to death!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN A BAD BOX.</p>


<p>Shadow was in a fix.</p>

<p>And it was a fix as bad as it was strange.</p>

<p>The pile of old junk through which the passage ran had
settled down, closing it up.</p>

<p>Retreat was now an impossibility. He must either find a
way out of the narrow prison he now found himself in by forging
ahead, or else must either reveal himself or starve to death
like a rat in a trap.</p>

<p>He was in a bad box and no mistake.</p>

<p>For the present he was compelled to lie perfectly quiet
where he was, for the noise of the pile in settling had drawn
to the spot several of the den's inmates.</p>

<p>Cap was seized with a fit of ill-humor over the occurrence,
which he accepted as evidence that the miscellaneous stuff had
been carelessly stowed.</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come, Cap?" Shadow heard one of the men rather
impatiently say. "You've said enough now, so haul in your
horns, for I, for one, won't stand any more."</p>

<p>They were all in one boat, to adopt a much-used simile.
And a certain number of them belonged to a co-operative sort
of an association, and consequently were on an even footing.</p>

<p>Over these men Cap had no authority, save that which he
had acquired from the fact of his being a very important man
in the association.</p>

<p>So now, when spoken to in this plain manner, Cap swallowed
his wrath, and discontinued his cursing the men with
him.</p>

<p>He said that he was afraid that the noise would attract attention
that might prove unwelcome.</p>

<p>But that was not the only reason for his anger at the settling
down of the big pile.</p>

<p>Another and stronger reason was that he had not a few
articles of considerable value stowed away in crannies at the
base of the big pile of junk.</p>

<p>These things were breakable, and for all he knew then, had
been completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Hiding his mingled anxiety and wrath, he now directed his
efforts toward drawing the men away from the spot, and succeeded
soon in doing so.</p>

<p>The moment Shadow heard them take their departure
he commenced moving about, examining into the facts of his
singular imprisonment.</p>

<p>He found himself in a place high enough to permit his crawling
about on his hands and knees, and about two feet in width
and ten in length.</p>

<p>Had it not been that he received a certain quantity of air
through the interstices of the pile, he must have suffocated.</p>

<p>As it was, it took only a very few minutes after the settling
down occurred before the air contained in the narrow place
became foul, and really unfit to breathe.</p>

<p>But it contained enough oxygen to support life, and once
satisfied of this, Shadow calmly pursued the task he was at.</p>

<p>Before long, however, Cap returned to inquire into the condition
of his hidden articles of value, and Shadow was compelled
to again become as quiet as a mouse.</p>

<p>He was more than satisfied with the result, since Cap's examination
involved the moving of a number of articles, and
the disposition of others in a manner which promised to make
it much easier for the mysterious detective to extricate himself
from his predicament.</p>

<p>Cap grunted.</p>

<p>And it was a grunt that indicated relief and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Although endangered, the articles concerning which he was
solicitous had not been injured.</p>

<p>Once more he took his departure, and again Shadow made
good use of his time.</p>

<p>The change which Cap had made permitted the better ingress
of air into Shadow's prison-pen, and he could now
breathe more easily.</p>

<p>Not a few times was he compelled to pause by the coming
of some of the gang, and it required hours of careful labor
before he had assured himself of having found a safe means of
exit from his narrow cell.</p>

<p>But he did not take immediate advantage of this means of
escape.</p>

<p>It would not have been in accordance with his plans.</p>

<p>Once having emerged he would have been compelled to walk
some distance in open sight, by a much used path, to reach
the stairs descending to the vaults beneath.</p>

<p>It was all he could hope for, could he once traverse the distance
without being observed.</p>

<p>He was hungry and thirsty, to be sure, and stood sadly in
need of rest.</p>

<p>But to have reached the vaults and gone through them to
procure food, then return and make the passage again to his
hiding-place, and then hope to reach the stairs by a third passage
of the open space, would have been to hug a foolish hope
to his breast.</p>

<p>No, he could not hope to more than once successfully make
the passage of the open space without being observed.</p>

<p>So it was practically a question to go hungry and thirsty,
or give up all idea of carrying his quest to completion.</p>

<p>The latter he would not do, until absolutely driven to it.</p>

<p>He decided on going hungry.</p>

<p>Only a light packing-case now stood between him and liberty&mdash;that
is, liberty as far as emerging from his prison was
concerned.</p>

<p>Having moved the box in and out to be sure that it did not
bind anywhere, and that he would not be delayed when the
time had come, in his judgment, to beat a retreat, he then
turned his attention toward extending the passage in the
direction of the office, in pursuance of his original intention.</p>

<p>It was already so close to the office that he could overhear
what was said, although not as clearly at all times as he wished.</p>

<p>Conquering his rebellious stomach, which clamored for food,
Shadow stuck to the task he had set for himself.</p>

<p>His pluck was properly rewarded, for he at last gained a
position in which the lowest-toned and most confidential conversation,
if above a low whisper, could be overheard.</p>

<p>And in the office there was a gathering not long after he
had gained this point of vantage.</p>

<p>Than that company of men in the so-called office, it would
have been a next to impossible task to have found an equal
number of deep-dyed scoundrels or red-handed villains.</p>

<p>There was a full moon, and the night was a clear one, and
the river-pirates do not choose such nights in which to ply
their vocation.</p>

<p>As men in honest callings in life will boast sometimes of
what they have done or can do, so villains when in secret
quarters, and believing themselves beyond prying ears, will
boast of their rascally feats.</p>

<p>An exceptional good humor and communicativeness seemed
to have descended on this occasion on the party in the office,
for they revealed many secret chapters of their lives to each
other in illustrating their various exploits.</p>

<p>One fellow told, with a hearty laugh, how, when engaged in
making away with a coil of rope, he had shot down the captain
of the sloop, the mate and the cook.</p>

<p>"It was just&mdash;pop&mdash;pop&mdash;pop&mdash;in reg'lar one, two, three
style, and down they went. They all 'kicked,' every one of
'em. Mebbe there wasn't a howl? Well, I just guess! But
the police never yet have found out who was responsible for
them there 'stiffs.'"</p>

<p>Another had even a more horrible story to tell of robbery
and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Another owned up to have "laid out" six men since the
day he first "gripped the graft."</p>

<p>And every word was drank eagerly in by a pair of acute and
hungering ears.</p>

<p>Shadow was highly excited, and his face was filled with an
expectant light.</p>

<p>He fully believed that one among the men gathered there
was the will-o'-the-wisp which he had so long been following,
and he was waiting until this one should utter a word that
would commit him, one word by which he would fasten on himself
a crime by which Shadow had sworn solemnly to avenge
in as terrible a manner as was within his power.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">DICK STANTON.</p>


<p>"You treacherous hound!" I angrily and indignantly exclaimed,
as I gave Stanton a hearty shaking when I learned
to a certainty that he had given a signal to call a crowd of
desperadoes to his assistance.</p>

<p>As the roughs began to pile out of the darkened saloon, the
false detective gave vent to a nervous laugh. He was afraid
he would not be rescued, and yet did not see how it could be
possible for me to retain him as a prisoner in the face of these
friends of his.</p>

<p>I was, however, determined to do so.</p>

<p>I was considerably riled up just about then, and could have
laid down my life rather than have let him escape.</p>

<p>I set my teeth.</p>

<p>Through them I hissed:</p>

<p>"Stanton, you cannot escape me! You know me well in
private life, and know that I am a determined man&mdash;a man of
my word. Now, then, I place the muzzle of my revolver to
your head, and by all that is holy I swear to shoot you rather
than let you escape."</p>

<p>Stanton gasped.</p>

<p>A hollow moan followed, and he became paler than a
corpse.</p>

<p>He knew me for a man of my word, and when I had thus
spoken he was positive that any attempt at rescue would cause
me to keep my word good.</p>

<p>Suddenly he brightened.</p>

<p>His tone was hopeful.</p>

<p>"How can I help it now?" he said; "I am helpless now,
either one way or the other."</p>

<p>There was a ring of something like triumph in his tone.</p>

<p>"Not so," I said sternly. "Order them back. You can
do that, and must do it! You know the alternative."</p>

<p>Stanton quivered and shook in his boots.</p>

<p>He was in a bad fix.</p>

<p>Instead of having the upper-hand of me, as he expected, he
was precisely under my thumb.</p>

<p>He saw all the ins and outs of his predicament at a glance.</p>

<p>He looked up at me in an uneasy, scared manner, and then
at the help he had summoned by that secret cry of distress.</p>

<p>He knew not what to do.</p>

<p>But decide he must, and that without further delay.</p>

<p>By this time the villainous gang he had summoned were beginning
to close in on me.</p>

<p>I pressed the muzzle more firmly against his temple, and I
heard his teeth chatter.</p>

<p>"Go back, boys!"</p>

<p>So he implored them.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, do not reveal your identity," I sternly
ordered him.</p>

<p>The gang halted in surprise.</p>

<p>They were stumped by his pleading with them not to make
any attempt at rescuing him.</p>

<p>"What in thunder did you give the secret cry for, then?"
demanded a gruff and angry voice. "Who are you, anyhow?
Give your number."</p>

<p>"Do it at your peril!" I hissed in Stanton's ear.</p>

<p>He understood the significance of the slightly harder pressure
of the deadly weapon against his temple.</p>

<p>I grimly maintained silence, save when I whispered a few
threatening words in the ear of the false detective.</p>

<p>It was a moment of quiet, yet intense excitement.</p>

<p>Bound by a terrible oath to answer that signal of distress,
the villains had rushed out to the rescue. Yet here was the
man who gave it now begging them not to interfere.</p>

<p>They were puzzled, and knew not what to do.</p>

<p>"Give your number," was again called out by the same
gruff voice as before.</p>

<p>"At your peril!"</p>

<p>So I again breathed into the false detective's ear, and he
made no reply.</p>

<p>"Now, then, let's get away from this spot," I said, in a
low tone; and still holding firmly to my prisoner, I began
slowly retreating, taking good care always to have an eye on
the gang, who were undecided what to do.</p>

<p>I quickly put a different aspect on the state of affairs when
I got a chance, and I gave the night-call for a policeman.</p>

<p>The gang continued to follow.</p>

<p>Had Stanton given his number, they were ready to rush in
and rescue him.</p>

<p>But for a good reason he did not give his number, and when
two blue-coats, having heard my summons, swiftly approached
the spot, the villainous crew's indecision vanished as well as
themselves.</p>

<p>Again warning Stanton not to reveal his identity, I met and
satisfied the guardians of the peace as to who I was.</p>

<p>They offered to accompany me to the station with my prisoner.</p>

<p>I declined their proffered services.</p>

<p>Having been assured that I considered all danger past,
they saluted and returned to their respective beats, and I resumed
my course with my prisoner.</p>

<p>Stanton was very chopfallen.</p>

<p>I had nipped his scheme of rescue in the bud, and he knew
that he was now in for it. His action, he felt sure, would kill
all sympathy I might have previously had for him.</p>

<p>Since his plan had failed, he knew it would have been better
for him had he never attempted to put it into execution.</p>

<p>I kept silence.</p>

<p>And Stanton never said a word.</p>

<p>I reached the place at last where I wanted to keep him in
confinement.</p>

<p>It was at the house of a deputy sheriff, who had built several
strong cells in his cellar, for occasions similar to the present.
And it not infrequently happens that when a detective has
captured a particular prisoner it is a decided benefit to be
able to keep the capture a profound secret for a while.</p>

<p>The place afforded the means of keeping the capture a
secret.</p>

<p>Fortunately the deputy was at home, and I soon had Stanton
locked up in one of the cells.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, as I entered the cell with the false detective,
"here you are, in a safe place, where the dogs won't bite
you."</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing with me?" the rascal tremblingly
asked me.</p>

<p>"Whatever I think you may deserve having done with
you," was the grim reply.</p>

<p>"Howard, I&mdash;I&mdash;didn't think any one was in that saloon,
or may be I wouldn't a-given that signal," he faltered.</p>

<p>"You know you lie!"</p>

<p>He winced.</p>

<p>He saw he could not fool or bamboozle me in the slightest
degree.</p>

<p>"Now, then," I said, presently, "are you going to make a
clean breast of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he loathfully answered.</p>

<p>The Black Hole, so called, crossed my mind.</p>

<p>"Who did you have in the Black Hole?"</p>

<p>"Black Hole! What Black Hole?"</p>

<p>"You can't come that. I know pretty much all about the
old sugar-house and Cap, and the kind of a business you carry
on there."</p>

<p>"How did you find out?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that. The Black Hole is in the cellar under
the store-house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted.</p>

<p>"You had a prisoner in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Describe him."</p>

<p>"A young fellow."</p>

<p>"A young fellow, inside of twenty, and of a slim build."</p>

<p>The description tallied.</p>

<p>"When did you last see him?"</p>

<p>"Just about dark."</p>

<p>"He was safe then?"</p>

<p>"He was."</p>

<p>"Could he have escaped from the Black Hole, think
you?"</p>

<p>Stanton gave a great start.</p>

<p>"It is possible," he said. "They thought it a mighty
strong place, but I didn't. A fellow with any grit could have
dug his way out."</p>

<p>That settled it to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>Shadow had been the prisoner in the Black Hole. That he
had got out somehow I had received ample proof by the hand
thrust up through the pile of junk holding that note for me.</p>

<p>I pumped Stanton for all he was worth. He kept back many
things, I knew; but I pretended to believe that he had made a
clean breast of it.</p>

<p>I had seen him glance about his cell, and knew that he
hoped to be able to make his escape.</p>

<p>"Ain't you a-goin' to take these irons off?" he inquired,
holding up his wrists, just as I was about to take my departure.</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend that you shall have your hands free to dig
your way out," with which I left him, decidedly crestfallen in
demeanor.</p>

<p>A few nights later I spent the entire period of darkness in
the neighborhood of the old sugar-house. Leaving just before
dawn, I was on my way home, when, as I drew near a corner,
I was suddenly confronted by a slenderly-built mulatto.</p>

<p>Gliding up before me, he extended his hand, and uttered
one word:</p>

<p>"Shadow!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A FIEND IN HUMAN SHAPE.</p>


<p>Poor Helen Dilt!</p>

<p>Better, much better, would it be for her to die at once, if
she was to be called on to long endure the torments that were
devised and executed by the ugly-faced hag who presided over
that private mad-house.</p>

<p>The hag was literally a fiend.</p>

<p>And a fiend in human form at that.</p>

<p>We speak of the natural love that resides in the human
heart, that is an indestructible part of it, that is born with it,
and never departs until the member has ceased to pulse, and
lies silent and heavy in the heart that contains it.</p>

<p>This fancy is a pretty one.</p>

<p>Few of us are there who do not try to paint humanity as
more humane than it really is.</p>

<p>Instead of love being the natural resident of the human
heart, it is something that is cultivated.</p>

<p>Left to itself, the feelings of the human heart are as savage
and fierce as those that reside in the hearts of the Indians of
the plains, or of the tigers in the Eastern jungles.</p>

<p>The old hag was one in whose heart tender feelings had
never been cultivated, and she was not burdened with sensations
of sympathy or pity.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the natural inclinations of a cruel nature
had been cultivated until it had become callous to all sensations
of pleasure save at the sight of the sufferings of some
living, breathing thing.</p>

<p>There is money in a private mad-house run by unscrupulous
persons, and several evil men had advanced the money and set
this human fiend up in business.</p>

<p>Few people have an idea of how easy it is, when there is a
splendid property to reward the horrible deed, for relations to
get a wealthy member of the family adjudged insane.</p>

<p>A single eccentricity is sufficient to do the thing.</p>

<p>And once the person is declared insane, into a private mad-house
he is inveigled, never again to see the light of day.
And there he is kept until he is actually driven mad, or until
death steps in and releases him.</p>

<p>The old hag had given herself, and delighted in, the name
of Tige.</p>

<p>It was a corruption or contraction of tigress.</p>

<p>And it was into such hands that poor Helen Dilt had fallen!</p>

<p>Again and again did the hag stick a big pin into Helen.</p>

<p>And again and again did she exultantly laugh at the evidences
of pain which the poor creature could not avoid displaying.</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet and docile?"</p>

<p>A jab with the pin.</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>Another jab.</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>Another prod with the bright pin, whose point was reddened
with Helen's blood.</p>

<p>"Will you, I say?"</p>

<p>Still another jab.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," Helen almost shrieked.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for you if you will bear your promise in
mind," said Tige, grimly. "I always make people regret
breaking their word with me."</p>

<p>Helen was left for some hours stretched on the bed, her
arms and feet extended and secured by ropes to the four
corners of the bed.</p>

<p>There was agony to be endured in even this quiet position.</p>

<p>Place a pound weight on the palm of your hand, and endeavor
to keep that hand extended, for, say five minutes.</p>

<p>Can you do it?</p>

<p>You think you can, that is if you have never tried it.</p>

<p>Try it now.</p>

<p>You will not be able to do it.</p>

<p>Long before the five minutes have expired your arm will be
a pathway for a succession of spasms of pain such as you have
never felt before.</p>

<p>All that you can voluntarily endure, quadrupled and more,
Helen was forced to pass through because of the strained
position of her arms.</p>

<p>It was terrible.</p>

<p>The pains that shot through her arms were frightful for a
while, and then the intensity diminished and her arms became
numb and felt as if dead.</p>

<p>She could no longer feel the cords so tightly fastened to her
wrists.</p>

<p>Her arms were perfectly bloodless, and to all intents and
purposes were dead.</p>

<p>They might almost have been amputated without causing
her any pain.</p>

<p>Food was finally brought her by a male attendant, a short,
thick-set, bull-headed individual, with the most brutal expressioned
face of any that Helen had ever seen.</p>

<p>He released her arms, and then lifted her by the shoulders
to a sitting posture on the bed.</p>

<p>Her hands were useless.</p>

<p>She could not raise them, could scarcely more than barely
move her fingers.</p>

<p>The attendant laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>"Don't they feel bully, eh?" he said, as he noted Helen's
face twitch with pain.</p>

<p>What anguish she presently suffered!</p>

<p>The tingling and burning as the blood began to flow back
into her arms were something awful.</p>

<p>"Tige understands the 'biz' if any one ever did," said the
bullet-headed attendant, laughing gayly. "But, I say, ain't
yer hungry? 'Cos if yer ain't, there's no good of my stayin'
here with this grub, which yer hain't touched these last ten
minutes."</p>

<p>But, although he badgered Helen, he did not take his departure
with the food.</p>

<p>He knew better than that.</p>

<p>Tige had ordered the food taken to Helen, and if she cared
to eat it he dared not leave until she had done so.</p>

<p>The old hag wanted to do nothing as yet that could in any
way injure Helen or disable her.</p>

<p>She made a point of doing with her patients exactly as was
ordered by her customers, and Brown had as yet not told her
what he wanted done with Helen.</p>

<p>Brown was expected when night had again fallen, and the
hag's expectations were not amiss.</p>

<p>Brown came.</p>

<p>At once he was closeted with the hag.</p>

<p>"Come, Brown, spit out just what you want," Tige impatiently
said, some minutes later. "I positively refuse to act
on hints, so you might's well say plumply what you want."</p>

<p>Brown was thoughtful.</p>

<p>It was his usual style to make people take what he wanted
for granted, as in the case of McGinnis.</p>

<p>This enabled him to lay back in his chair and say:</p>

<p>"I did not tell you to do anything of the kind. If you chose
to put that interpretation on my words I can't help it. It
wasn't my fault that you did."</p>

<p>He was a wily man.</p>

<p>But Tige was equally as wily.</p>

<p>Her safety lay in forcing her customers to commit themselves,
and knowing that she would take no steps as regarded
any patient without having received point-blank orders.</p>

<p>Brown was Helen's uncle.</p>

<p>Property of hers, which he had robbed her of, he managed to
hold himself without question. But he dared not sell it or try
to transfer it.</p>

<p>If Helen were insane, then it would be policy to prove her
identity, be appointed her guardian, and then when she died,
the court would decide that he was the legal heir, and confirm
him in his title to the property.</p>

<p>It was this which he was now conning over in his mind.</p>

<p>"Well?" from Tige.</p>

<p>"The girl is insane?"</p>

<p>"Of course," with a curl of the lip.</p>

<p>"I should like to carry her before some big physicians, and
have them certify to the fact."</p>

<p>"In other words, you want me to drive the girl to real insanity?
Is that the plain English of it&mdash;yes or no?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And if it can't be done?"</p>

<p>"She must be put out of the way unless you can drive her
mad," Brown said, in a low tone. "Fix your own price for
the job; I only ask that you do it well."</p>

<p>This was the horrid compact that they entered into regarding
Helen.</p>

<p>Poor Helen! poor&mdash;poor Helen!</p>

<p>With fiendish zest the hag set about her horrid work without
loss of time.</p>

<p>That very night Helen was gagged to stifle her cries, and
was securely bound to the bed, after which Tige amused herself
by stripping the victim's feet, and then pulling the nails
from her toes with a pincers.</p>

<p>And during the terrible ordeal, the sweat-drops of awful
agony rolled down Helen's face, and she writhed and strained,
but in vain, to burst the bonds which held her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">DISAPPOINTED AGAIN.</p>


<p>With ears wide open, and with an expression of intense
interest, Shadow remained stretched in the narrow passage
in the pile of old junk, listening to the words that fell from the
lips of the villains gathered there in the office.</p>

<p>He was all expectancy.</p>

<p>He fully believed that one among the rascals could solve
the mystery which he had so long been endeavoring to probe.</p>

<p>Would this particular fellow tell of this particular rascally
exploit?</p>

<p>Shadow hoped so.</p>

<p>As time passed by, however, without one word being said,
the mysterious detective began to grow impatient, since the
particular thing about which he wished to learn was not mentioned.</p>

<p>However, he paid strict attention to the many stories of
rascality which they told. The knowledge thus derived might
be of use some time.</p>

<p>More than once the secret listener shuddered on hearing
the tales that were told.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if all the crimes that were ever committed
could not sum up as large a total as these men boasted
of having committed.</p>

<p>And, at the moment when his cheeks were paling over some
horrid relation, he could hear the whole gang joining in a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>That they were able to laugh over descriptions of bloodshed
and death was ample evidence of the manner of men they were,
and Shadow more fully realized the peril which surrounded
him so long as he should remain in the old sugar-house.</p>

<p>"That's the list of the things I've done, and never been
nabbed yet," said one, as he finished a story of crime.</p>

<p>"You've heard all my exploits," said another.</p>

<p>"And mine."</p>

<p>"And mine."</p>

<p>Shadow sighed.</p>

<p>Not one word concerning that of which he wished to hear
had been uttered.</p>

<p>He had waited expectantly&mdash;had hoped until the very last
boastful tale had been told, but had hoped in vain.</p>

<p>And now the sigh that he gave utterance to was filled with
disappointment.</p>

<p>His head sadly drooped, and he felt as if he hardly cared
whether his presence was discovered or not. Repeated disappointments
had taken away his courage for the time being.</p>

<p>It was now very late.</p>

<p>Morning was not so very far distant, and the villainous
party broke up and left the place, to separate and depart for
their various places of abode.</p>

<p>At last an intense silence rested over the place, and except
the sentinel at the door and Cap in a distant corner, in a partitioned-off
room, Shadow was alone in the big place.</p>

<p>Reckless, and disheartened, and discouraged as he had felt,
he had been wise enough to remain so silent as not to betray
himself.</p>

<p>Up to the present moment he had not stirred. But now he
shifted his position a little to a more comfortable one, and became
lost in thought.</p>

<p>He had been disappointed before&mdash;had been cast down, but
had recovered both confidence and courage. Why could he
not do so now?</p>

<p>So he asked himself.</p>

<p>Patience and perseverance never yet failed to meet with a
proper reward, he told himself, and presently he began to
brighten up&mdash;became more hopeful.</p>

<p>Was there any use in longer remaining here in the old sugar-house?</p>

<p>Clearly not, he thought.</p>

<p>Then to bid it farewell.</p>

<p>He backed down the passage until he reached the spot
where Cap had so disarranged the "stuff" as to leave only
an empty box between the passage and the open floor beyond.</p>

<p>After listening a minute, Shadow then softly shoved back
the box, without making any noise, and next crawled out of
his cramped quarters.</p>

<p>Before attempting to move away from the spot, he was sensible
enough to wait until he had got some fresh breath, and
had limbered himself up a little.</p>

<p>Perhaps five minutes later, he started toward the stairs that
descended to the vaults below.</p>

<p>It was necessary to approach within a dozen or fifteen feet
of the sentinel.</p>

<p>Knowing of the latter's presence, Shadow exercised great
caution as he drew near him. Had the sentinel been wide-awake
and bright, Shadow could hardly have made the passage
undetected.</p>

<p>But the fellow was nodding in a state of half-slumber, and
failed to hear the light-footed detective.</p>

<p>Shadow safely reached the head of the stairs, and commenced
descending. The descent was safely accomplished,
and once in the vault, all danger was passed.</p>

<p>On stepping forth into the streets, his first care was to visit
a restaurant; and how he did eat.</p>

<p>"I say," remarked the waiter, after having received a third
and a fourth order from Shadow, "I say," and his eyes were
big as saucers in his surprise, "be you holler clean down to
your heels?"</p>

<p>"I'm hungry, that's all."</p>

<p>"Hungry? Well, I should say so."</p>

<p>On receiving a fifth order from the detective, the waiter, before
filling it, took the proprietor of the place into a consultation.</p>

<p>Shadow's grub bill was of a pretty good size, and from his
appearance the waiter was in doubt as to whether he was
good for the amount, let alone a greater one.</p>

<p>"Show your hand, young feller," remarked the waiter, on
returning, before placing the ordered edibles before Shadow.</p>

<p>The latter understood, and a quiet smile began playing about
his lips.</p>

<p>Placing his hand in his pocket he took out and ostentatiously
laid down a five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" grunted the waiter, setting down the
plates. "Fill up the cavity. I guess I kin fetch the grub as
fast as you kin stow it away."</p>

<p>With Shadow's departure from the restaurant we must drop
him for a while. But we again introduce him, disguised as a
mulatto, as he glided up to the writer of these lines, and, with
extended hand, simply said:</p>

<p>"Shadow!"</p>

<p>Was this Shadow?</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my eyes.</p>

<p>Adept as I was myself in the arts of disguise, if this was the
mysterious detective, he was able to equal if not even outdo
my ability.</p>

<p>"Shadow!"</p>

<p>So he repeated, when I allowed a full minute to pass without
having spoken a word.</p>

<p>"Are you Shadow?"</p>

<p>He made a disdainful gesture, and in an impatient tone repeated
that one word.</p>

<p>"I want you to answer me a few questions," I said.</p>

<p>An instant later I could no longer doubt his identity. He
raised his hand, and I saw him shake his index finger in that
peculiar way, as I saw him do on the occasion of our first acquaintance,
when I saw his shadow do the same thing. But
there was a difference, since, on the present occasion, the
finger was shaken at me.</p>

<p>Then he remained holding out his hand, and I could not but
know what it was he wanted.</p>

<p>It was his share of the reward, which he had not yet claimed.</p>

<p>I found that to ask him any questions would only result in
angering him, so I placed a roll of bills in his hands, which I
had kept ready and waiting for him.</p>

<p>Without a word of thanks or farewell, he turned on his heel,
and within the space of a minute had vanished from my sight.</p>

<p>Our meeting had occurred on a corner, before the doors of
a liquor saloon. Several hard characters had watched us, and
by aid of the lamp on the corner had seen that it was a roll of
bills that I handed Shadow, although, of course, they knew
neither of us.</p>

<p>Instantly they took a hasty departure by means of a back
entrance, their object being to attack and rob the mysterious
detective.</p>

<p>By means of an alley-way they headed him off, and lying in
ambush, sprang out upon his approach, and flung themselves
toward him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HELEN'S TORTURE.</p>


<p>Bound so tightly that she could not rise&mdash;could not resist,
Helen Dilt was put to the torture by the cruel hag, who had
received orders to either drive her actually mad or kill her.</p>

<p>Helen at first had screamed.</p>

<p>A continuance of this was prevented by the hag, who gagged
Helen most effectually.</p>

<p>Tige was a fiend.</p>

<p>A fiend!</p>

<p>The word has not sufficient meaning to describe what she
really was.</p>

<p>If Satan ever quits his sulphurous house to take up his residence
in a particular human being, he certainly was residing
then in the earthly form of the terrible woman who presided
over that private mad-house, and was the arbiter of the fates
of so many beings who were helpless in her vile clutches.</p>

<p>And torture!</p>

<p>And the sight of human agony!</p>

<p>She loved them.</p>

<p>She loved to hear the shrieks of agony that she wrung from
her victims. As prudence made it necessary to still these
sounds by gags, the fiendish woman refined her cruelties the
more, that the loss of this horrid music might be compensated
for by the greater writhings of her victims.</p>

<p>Regarding Helen, her instructions were as plain as they
were fiendish!</p>

<p>"Drive her mad or kill her!"</p>

<p>In few cases was she allowed so broad a latitude of action,
and she proceeded to Helen's torture with the same zest that
a gourmand exhibits when he sits down before a table that
groans beneath the weight of some particular thing which he
loves to exercise his teeth upon.</p>

<p>Helen was fastened to the bed securely, and, as we have
said, was gagged.</p>

<p>And then, as stated in a previous chapter, Tige amused
herself by taking a pincers and dragging out the nails of
Helen's toes.</p>

<p>Kind Heaven, what agony that is!</p>

<p>It is terrible!</p>

<p>Terrible! Yes, and awful and horrible as well!</p>

<p>How Helen suffered!</p>

<p>How she strained&mdash;but in vain&mdash;to burst the bonds which
held her!</p>

<p>How Tige chuckled!</p>

<p>How she gloated!</p>

<p>How she made Helen writhe and moan!</p>

<p>The dewdrops of agony were not long in making their appearance
on the victim's forehead&mdash;great, large drops, which
rolled off and down her face to make room for others.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Tige, showing her teeth like a snarling
dog; "oh-ho! don't I love this! Groan and moan and twist
and squirm; it is all a feast to me."</p>

<p>And Helen suffered so much that she would have hailed
death as a welcome release.</p>

<p>Aye, she even prayed that she might die.</p>

<p>She had nothing to hope for; rescue she thought impossible,
or it would have been accomplished before this. To die
would be the easiest way for her.</p>

<p>"There, how did that feel?"</p>

<p>Tige asked the question with a chuckle, as she ripped another
nail out of the living flesh.</p>

<p>Feel!</p>

<p>Helen was writhing in anguish.</p>

<p>She made one more effort to burst her bonds.</p>

<p>She strained until the veins were swollen out on her face
and neck like whipcords, and seemed on the point of bursting.</p>

<p>But the work of tying her had been too well done, and she
finally fell back in a state of utter exhaustion, with moan after
moan coming in a sort of ripple.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the fiendish hag; "make such a fuss
about a little one like that, which came out so easily? Why,
I should have considered that one a pleasure. Just wait until
I get hold of the big one. Ha, ha! that's where the fun comes
in. You see, it's more deeply rooted, and I've seen some I
wasn't strong enough to pull until I rigged up a sort of tackle
I have for the purpose."</p>

<p>Helen shuddered.</p>

<p>And well she might.</p>

<p>Poor girl!</p>

<p>It was monstrous that the law should permit the existence
of such places&mdash;such private mad-houses&mdash;where such infernal
wickedness can be enacted.</p>

<p>Tige was grinning like a hyena.</p>

<p>She made one or two feints of pursuing her hideous work,
and then halted to gloat over the shudder which each time
thrilled her victim's frame.</p>

<p>At last she fastened the pincers on the nail of one of Helen's
great toes.</p>

<p>She gave a strong twitch.</p>

<p>Helen groaned.</p>

<p>The human hyena gave a stronger pull.</p>

<p>Helen lifted herself to the limit her bonds permitted, and
flung herself against the ropes, which would not break, but held
her with cruel rigor.</p>

<p>Again Tige pulled.</p>

<p>And this time pulled direct, and with an amount of strength
which could not have dwelt in a less sinewy frame than hers.</p>

<p>Then she twisted the pincers.</p>

<p>Had she been free from her gag, Helen must have shrieked
so loudly that she would have been heard for blocks around.</p>

<p>Again Tige pulled direct.</p>

<p>She meanwhile kept watch of Helen's face.</p>

<p>Her victim could stand no more.</p>

<p>This Tige saw.</p>

<p>"Now!" she hissed.</p>

<p>Then, exerting her strength, she threw it all into that one
motion, and&mdash;&mdash; As the nail was dragged out by the roots,
Helen uttered one long, quivering moan, and then laid there
pallid and motionless.</p>

<p>One would have thought her dead.</p>

<p>But Tige's experience told her different.</p>

<p>She knew that Helen had only fainted.</p>

<p>And she knew, also, that the suffering she had endured
would produce a nervous shock from which Helen might never
recover.</p>

<p>Tige made no attempt to release Helen from her bonds.</p>

<p>She merely loosened the gag a little, that she might breathe
easier.</p>

<p>Then flinging a pail of water over her victim, as she might
have flung a worthless bone to a cur, Tige took her departure,
allowing Helen to return to consciousness or die, she did not
much care which.</p>

<p>But she did not forget to take with her the nails she had extracted.</p>

<p>Reaching the door of her own room, secured by a number
of strong and elaborately made locks, she paused to unlock it,
and then entered.</p>

<p>At one side of the room was a bed, in the center a table, in
one recess a sofa, which, in addition to a few chairs, made up
the furniture of the room, save a small glass-front cabinet that
was attached to the wall.</p>

<p>The door of this she unlocked.</p>

<p>Glancing in, she gave vent to a chuckle that was perfectly
horrid.</p>

<p>What was it&mdash;perhaps you ask&mdash;that produced this chuckle
on Tige's part?</p>

<p>Nothing more nor less than a few score of human toe-nails,
dragged out by the roots as Helen's had been.</p>

<p>They were the horrible mementoes that drew back to her
memory those whom she had tortured in days gone by.</p>

<p>And to this collection she now had an addition to make, an
addition furnished at the expense of a poor girl who had never
wronged a person in the world, who had never made herself
an enemy, but who simply stood in an evil man's way to a
fortune.</p>

<p>Helen did not die.</p>

<p>No, she lived, ardently as she prayed that she might not.</p>

<p>And of a strength of character that is unusual in a woman,
she did not suffer as great a nervous shock as Tige had anticipated.</p>

<p>"I guess it'll have to be 'kill her!'" the hyena-like woman
muttered to herself. "But I'll not do that until I've had a
little more fun with her."</p>

<p>Fun!</p>

<p>If fun it was to her, she had plenty of it. But to her victim
it was something far&mdash;far different!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">PUZZLED.</p>


<p>Several days after meeting Shadow in his disguise of a
mulatto, I was the recipient of a letter which puzzled me not
a little.</p>

<p>The text was simple enough.</p>

<p>The letter read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Howard.</span>&mdash;Herewith I return you the money you so
kindly loaned me on an occasion that was filled with sadness
for me. You will remember the occasion to which I refer&mdash;when
Tom Smith was killed, and you so generously provided
me with the means of interring him in mother earth.</p>

<p>"That I am deeply grateful you may rest assured, and perhaps
at some future time I may be able to testify to the depth
of my gratitude.</p>

<p>"Accept my thanks with the money I return, a kind of interest
on the loan, which I am satisfied you will best like.</p>

<p class="sig" style="margin-right: 8em;">
"Yours gratefully,<br />
</p>
<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Nellie Millbank</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>A very nicely worded and straightforward letter. Don't
you think so?</p>

<p>Of course you do.</p>

<p>Then, why was I puzzled?</p>

<p>Simply because when I received the letter, and before opening
it, I said as I glanced at the penmanship of the address:</p>

<p>"Another letter from Shadow," and then, on opening it,
found that it was not.</p>

<p>I had preserved Shadow's letters or notes, and these I now
brought out and compared with this epistle from Nellie Millbank.</p>

<p>The penmanship was "as like as two peas."</p>

<p>Now, then, if you have read the foregoing chapters with
any interest, you can see why I was puzzled.</p>

<p>Was Nellie Millbank the mysterious little detective?</p>

<p>As I said, provided your interest has been deep enough,
you know that I had strong reasons, and many of them, for
supposing Shadow to be none other than young Mat Morris.</p>

<p>Let us recount some reasons.</p>

<p>I had taxed Shadow with being Mat Morris, and he had not
denied it.</p>

<p>Then, I had paid Shadow five hundred dollars, and had afterwards
seen the very bills themselves in the hands of Mat's
mother.</p>

<p>This last circumstance was of itself strong evidence that
Mat and Shadow were one and the same person.</p>

<p>Then there was the manner Shadow had of carrying himself&mdash;Mat
Morris' style exactly.</p>

<p>A person's manner of bearing himself, and his mode of
walking, and the use of his hands and head when speaking,
are things that no disguise can hide.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I had been ready to almost take an oath as
to the true identity of Shadow.</p>

<p>Yet here comes a letter that completely upsets all my faith
in my powers of penetration.</p>

<p>If the writing of Nellie Millbank and of Shadow was the
same, then Mat evidently was not Shadow. And if Mat was
not Shadow, who was?</p>

<p>Nellie Millbank?</p>

<p>It was barely possible.</p>

<p>That slip of a girl do what I knew Shadow was capable
of doing, as well as what he had done?</p>

<p>It was not to be credited.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;the similarity of the handwriting. How was that
to be accounted for?</p>

<p>I thought of Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>I intended to go and show her one of the Shadow letters,
and inquire if she knew the writing.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the house where Mrs. Morris lived, it
was to learn that she had moved away early that morning.</p>

<p>Where to, nobody knew.</p>

<p>Balked in this direction, I turned my steps toward the house
of the deputy sheriff, in a cell beneath whose house, it will be
remembered, I had in confinement Dick Stanton, the false detective.</p>

<p>No sooner did the treacherous detective see me than he began
whining like a whipped cur, and begged like a dog to be
let go, or be dealt with mercifully.</p>

<p>If I would only release him, he said, he would "give away"
his pals of the sugar-house, besides putting into my hands
numbers of clews in connection with various crimes.</p>

<p>"And they won't be false scents," he said earnestly. "I'll
deal square with you, Howard, I swear I will. It will get
promotion for you, sure, if you bag the game I can put you on
the track of."</p>

<p>I had, however, paid him a visit for a particular purpose,
and evading all his questions and turning a deaf ear to his
entreaties, I told him I wanted to know if the prisoner who
had been confined in the black hole was male or female.</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>"Male or female?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Male, of course."</p>

<p>"You are sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Sure of it? Why, he was a man just as much as you are
a man, or I am one."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are not a man&mdash;except in name," I rejoined (and
the words made him wince) "so do not bring yourself into
the comparison."</p>

<p>I made him give me a close description of the prisoner who
had been confined in the black hole, and after listening to it,
I could have no manner of doubt that the person was other
than Mat Morris.</p>

<p>"And," volunteered Stanton, "moreover, he was a surly
sort of a customer. We couldn't get a word out of him."</p>

<p>This tallied with Shadow.</p>

<p>I left Stanton still ironed, despite his prayers to at least
have the handcuffs taken off.</p>

<p>"You deserve all the punishment you are enduring," I bitingly
told him.</p>

<p>I no longer doubted that Mat Morris and the mysterious detective
were one and the same person. All the evidence
pointed toward that conclusion.</p>

<p>It was a stickler.</p>

<p>I dropped in to see a writing expert, and after examining
them, he said that the two specimens might or might not be
written by the same person.</p>

<p>"It is penmanship as taught in our public schools," he
said. "Pupils are drilled into a set way of forming their letters,
as a consequence of which there is a great similarity in
writing until the persons have been for years out of school."</p>

<p>That settled it.</p>

<p>The similarity was one caused by education, and I was more
than ever convinced of Mat and Shadow being one individual.</p>

<p>I went home in a thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>There I found a letter awaiting me from the chief, asking
why I had not reported in a certain matter which had been
placed in my hands.</p>

<p>I felt conscience-stricken.</p>

<p>In my great interest in what concerned Shadow I had neglected
my duty, to which the last few hours should have been
devoted, instead of to an endeavor to find out whether Shadow
was Mat Morris, or Nellie Millbank, or somebody else.</p>

<p>Immediately I donned the disguise in which I had acted a
part, and wound my way into the confidence of Woglom and
his companion, by means of which I had learned of the prisoner
in the black hole.</p>

<p>At once I started out.</p>

<p>In their usual place of resort I, that evening, encountered
the precious pair of rascals.</p>

<p>They were rather shy of me at first, not liking my sudden
and unaccounted-for absence, but an off-hand manner and a
few drinks fixed matters all right.</p>

<p>After that they seemed to take to me amazingly, and I noticed
them glancing first at me and then at each other with an
askance expression.</p>

<p>I knew that something was afoot, and patiently waited to
hear what it was.</p>

<p>After awhile they withdrew to a little distance and began to
earnestly converse, concerning me, I was quite positive.</p>

<p>Such indeed was the truth.</p>

<p>They were discussing the advisability of taking me into their
confidence, and making me a party in a villainous scheme
that was already hatched.</p>

<p>"Want to go into a big job with us?" Woglom asked me,
on their resuming their seats.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if there's enough 'swag' to pay for the trouble,"
I replied. "What is the line?"</p>

<p>My answer satisfied them, and they unfolded their scheme.
It was a scheme into which I entered for a purpose; they
were to put it into execution that night, and I accompanied
them&mdash;accompanied them into as great a peril as ever threatened
my life.</p>

<p>I shudder, even now, when I think of that night.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN DEADLY PERIL.</p>


<p>Never shall I forget the adventures of the night when I accompanied
Woglom and his pal on that expedition.</p>

<p>I have been in many ticklish places, but I never got into
one where I was worse stumped than I was that night.</p>

<p>The circumstances were very peculiar, and the knowledge
that at any moment I might be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But, perhaps, it would be more intelligible to the reader,
did I begin at the beginning and narrate the incidents of that
escapade.</p>

<p>While the pair of precious villains pretended to have taken
me fully into their confidence, they had not really done so.</p>

<p>They were going to break into a house.</p>

<p>This much was truth.</p>

<p>But, as I understood them, the house was in the suburbs&mdash;somewhere
in the neighborhood of Fort Washington, I took it.</p>

<p>It was because I believed that vicinity contained the intended
scene of robbery, that I so readily consented to accompany
them.</p>

<p>I would probably be left outside to keep guard, and would
take advantage of the circumstance to call the police, and be
on hand to bag them when they came out with their plunder.</p>

<p>It was not until after we had got started that I was undeceived.</p>

<p>I then learned that the "suburbs," as they meant it, was
in New Jersey, on the line of the Central Railroad.</p>

<p>A train left near midnight.</p>

<p>This was the train we were to take, to reach which we were
compelled to somewhat hasten our pace.</p>

<p>I was puzzled to know what to do.</p>

<p>I might have called for assistance on the policemen we
passed, and have taken them into custody.</p>

<p>But this would have been worse than useless under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The rascals could not be held and punished because it could
not be proved that they had <i>intended</i> committing a robbery.</p>

<p>Men cannot be sent to prison for intention of wrong. They
must be proved to have committed the wrong.</p>

<p>Should I back out of accompanying them?</p>

<p>So I asked myself.</p>

<p>While still in a state of uncertainty we reached the ferry.</p>

<p>"I will go along," I mentally decided. "I may be able to
give an alarm and collar them there as well as if it had taken
place here."</p>

<p>And so I went.</p>

<p>We reached the little town after a short ride in the cars, a
little town which I shall not name, but which is noted for its
handsome residences, and its wealthy people.</p>

<p>While on a tramp through the country Woglom had applied
at the house for something to eat.</p>

<p>He was provided with food, and asked if he did not wish to
work. He said "Yes." He was put to work cleaning out
the cellar of the house.</p>

<p>Such an opportunity was not to be thrown aside.</p>

<p>He made a diagram of the interior of the house, and located
its rooms and the furniture in them with an accuracy that
comes only by practice.</p>

<p>This was the house that we were on the way to "crack"
that night.</p>

<p>We reached it.</p>

<p>Passing by, we paused at a little distance to hold a consultation.</p>

<p>The house was all dark and silent, the sky was somewhat
clouded, and everything seemed favorable for our undertaking.</p>

<p>I was given a bottle of chloroform, and on my pleading
ignorance, was instructed how to use it.</p>

<p>There was no need here of any one remaining outside to
watch.</p>

<p>We were all to enter.</p>

<p>When Woglom was in the house, he had made use of a
"crooked" man's never-absent companion, a screw-driver.</p>

<p>With this he had loosened the screws of the iron buttons
which secured the cellar windows, which were then left so
poorly secured that a slight push would be sufficient to open
them.</p>

<p>Consulting his diagram by the light of a match, Woglom
located the particular window which he considered it most
advisable to attack.</p>

<p>With soft steps we crept around the house, keeping close to
it.</p>

<p>We reached the window.</p>

<p>Woglom went down on his knees before it.</p>

<p>Listening a minute, and finding everything continued quiet,
the master-villain applied a gentle pressure to the window.</p>

<p>It did not give.</p>

<p>He pressed harder.</p>

<p>Still it remained firmly secured.</p>

<p>Harder still he pressed.</p>

<p>Then I heard him utter an oath.</p>

<p>By some manner, or by accident, the inmates had discovered
that the windows had been tampered with, and had re-fastened
the buttons.</p>

<p>Again we consulted, having withdrawn for that purpose.</p>

<p>It was Woglom's opinion, that while the looseness of the buttons
had been noticed, the inhabitants of the house would hardly
be likely to suppose it a piece of work preparatory to a robbery.</p>

<p>"Shall we go ahead then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the decision.</p>

<p>Back to the house we went.</p>

<p>Again we paused at the window.</p>

<p>From his pockets Woglom now produced a number of implements.</p>

<p>Against the window pane he pressed a bit of a sticky substance
resembling putty, and then sunk the head of a tool he
did not wish to use in the stuff.</p>

<p>This done, he made use of a glazier's point.</p>

<p>He made a circular cut on the pane, the putty forming the
central point or axis.</p>

<p>Now he tapped gently on the cut glass with an iron chisel,
whose head was covered by a piece of felt cloth to deaden the
sound.</p>

<p>Presently the cut portion gave way.</p>

<p>Now the use of the putty became apparent. It was to prevent
the cut-out part of the glass from falling and shattering
on the floor inside.</p>

<p>The ingenuity, the great care, the art with which burglars
work is a revelation to those who have no knowledge of the
methods by which such startling robberies are made possible.</p>

<p>The circular piece of glass was brought to the outside and
laid carefully down.</p>

<p>Through the aperture thus formed a hand could be inserted,
and the buttons turned about, when the window could be
easily opened, permitting ingress to the cellar.</p>

<p>Once this was gained, little or no trouble would be experienced
in reaching the upper portions of the house.</p>

<p>Woglom inserted his hand.</p>

<p>He reached the button at one side and turned it.</p>

<p>He then reached out for the other button, and&mdash;a wild howl
gave me an awful start.</p>

<p>Woglom had uttered it.</p>

<p>Following close upon its heels came a string of horrible
oaths.</p>

<p>"What's up&mdash;what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"My hand is caught in some sort of a contrivance!" moaned
or groaned Woglom. "Quick&mdash;the hole is big enough&mdash;try
and get my hand loose."</p>

<p>His pal inserted his hand.</p>

<p>Now was my time to capture them!</p>

<p>I drew my revolver, and had taken a forward stop, when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Almost beneath my feet a spring gun was discharged, and
I could hear the big buckshot&mdash;each one a young bullet&mdash;buzzing
about my ears, like a swarm of hungry flies on a hot
summer's day.</p>

<p>I paused.</p>

<p>A window went up.</p>

<p>A head appeared and a stern voice said:</p>

<p>"Aha! I've got you now, you rascals;" and I saw the muzzle
of a gun appear. "Stay where you are if you value your
lives! A dozen spring guns are concealed just there, and a
single step may discharge them all."</p>

<p>Heaven!</p>

<p>The cold sweat started from every pore of my body.</p>

<p>Spring guns!</p>

<p>What infernal things they are, anyhow.</p>

<p>I trembled. Yes, I own up to it&mdash;I trembled. And so, I
think, any man would who was made of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>It was an awful feeling, to know that a mine was concealed
right beneath your feet, which the slightest move might cause
to explode.</p>

<p>Did I stand still?</p>

<p>Well&mdash;I think I did. I was rooted to the spot, and with
horror watched Woglom's struggles to free himself, for I
feared that his movements would cause the dreaded explosion.</p>

<p class="center">STILL SEARCHING.</p>


<p>All possibility of Shadow being Nellie Millbank would have
been driven from my mind had I been where I could see him
after parting with him on the night when I gave him the
money.</p>

<p>Seen to receive a roll of bills by a party of rascals, they had
made use of an alley-way to head him off, and then suddenly
sprang on him from an ambush.</p>

<p>The possibility alluded to would have been killed by the
coolness of Shadow's demeanor, by his quick-witted promptness
taking his measures to disconcert the villains, by the
exhibition of courage displayed by him.</p>

<p>The whole thing could never be a part of a woman's character.</p>

<p>Only a man, and not an ordinary man at that, could have
acted as Shadow did under those trying circumstances.</p>

<p>He showed no disconcertion whatever when so suddenly attacked.</p>

<p>Agile as a cat in every movement, he gave a backward
spring the moment they broke cover.</p>

<p>Before they could reach him, his hand had clasped the butt
of his revolver.</p>

<p>The next second it was out.</p>

<p>They had then reached him&mdash;had him hemmed in, but he
forced a passage by grimly pointing his revolver at the head
of one of them.</p>

<p>He uttered not a word.</p>

<p>He did not forget himself, nor cease to maintain that singular
silence which he seemed to have forced upon himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps his silence added to the effect of his threatening
movements, but at any rate the villainous quartette shrank
away from him, feeling they had caught a Tartar.</p>

<p>Shadow never lost his composure.</p>

<p>Keeping his face to them, he slowly backed away from them.</p>

<p>They followed him up, chagrined, yet resolute, wishing to
retrieve their mistake.</p>

<p>One or two swift glances Shadow threw behind him, then
changed the line of his retreat, at last fetching up in a doorway.</p>

<p>With his back planted against the door, the villains could
only attack him from the front, and this&mdash;well, Shadow smiled.
He gauged their temper and courage to a T.</p>

<p>Fire-arms are tools too noisy for such fellows, and they were
armed with knives. To make these effective it was necessary
to get within arm's length.</p>

<p>But to do this in the face of Shadow's revolver was a task
they had little relish to attempt.</p>

<p>Silent as the grave itself, and grim as a man of stone,
Shadow kept his revolver raised, his finger on the trigger,
ready to defend himself.</p>

<p>Nearer came the villains.</p>

<p>Shadow made no movement until they were within a half-dozen
feet of him, and then he slightly waved his deadly
weapon to warn them away.</p>

<p>They paused.</p>

<p>Glaring at him, they cursed under their breaths.</p>

<p>To be balked was bad enough.</p>

<p>But to be balked in this off-hand, cool, easy manner, was far
worse.</p>

<p>But what could they do?</p>

<p>They could not fail to see and understand that a revolver
was aimed at them with deadly intent.</p>

<p>They well knew that a bullet is a messenger which travels
rapidly, and if the mulatto's aim was as true as his arm was
steady, to attempt to rush on him would be the death-signal of
at least one of their number.</p>

<p>This fact was evident.</p>

<p>And they hung back in an undecided state of mind.</p>

<p>Shadow laughed quietly.</p>

<p>He had the advantage&mdash;had turned the tables, and was
aware of it.</p>

<p>He now assumed the aggressive, and took a step toward
them, menacing them with the loaded and cocked weapon.</p>

<p>They retreated.</p>

<p>Finally one uttered a few low, hoarse-toned words, and then
they took to their heels, Shadow after them.</p>

<p>Around the corner they dashed, but the detective kept them
in sight until they disappeared into the alley-way which they
had used to head him off. It was a singular incident, and
would have appeared so to any one who could have been there
to witness it. Nor was it any the less thrilling that it was so
quiet.</p>

<p>During the whole affair, from beginning to end, Shadow had
uttered no word, but had preserved that mysterious silence in
which he had wrapped himself, for causing him to break which
on a certain occasion he had poured out on my head the vials
of his wrath.</p>

<p>He had conquered four desperate men, had done it in as calm
a manner as he would have eaten his dinner.</p>

<p>Verily, he was a mysterious being.</p>

<p>In thinking of him afterward, it seemed to me as if his path
and mine were always crossing, for it was due to him that
Woglom and his pal and myself were placed in our horrible
fix.</p>

<p>The gentleman who lived in this place had been visited one
evening by a mulatto.</p>

<p>"A mulatto&mdash;a negro?" he said, when the girl told him
that such a person wished to see him. "What does he
want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. He jist showed me a bit of paper wid
'I want to see the master of the house' on it."</p>

<p>"Take him into the library."</p>

<p>As the reader will readily suppose, the mulatto was Shadow.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Woglom and his pal were connected
with the sugar-house gang.</p>

<p>Woglom was "down on his luck" so badly as to have been
obliged to dispose of his burglarious implements. He had
visited Cap to be supplied with some tools.</p>

<p>Cap demanded to know what Woglom was going to do with
them, and what were the chances of his success, before lending
him what he wanted&mdash;for a good round consideration.</p>

<p>Thus, while in concealment in the passage under the junk
pile, Shadow had learned the particulars of this "job."</p>

<p>"You wished to see me?" said the master of the house, as
he entered the library, where Shadow had been shown.</p>

<p>The detective bowed, pointed to the open desk, then took
paper and pencil and wrote:</p>

<p>"A plan has been formed to rob your house."</p>

<p>Reading this, the gentleman gave a start of surprise, then
looked more closely at Shadow.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A detective," Shadow replied, in writing.</p>

<p>In terms as brief as possible he outlined the case, spoke of
the tramp they had given food and a day's work to, and told
him he would find that the fastenings of the cellar windows
had been tampered with.</p>

<p>Having warned the gentleman, Shadow retired, refusing
either pay or refreshment tendered him.</p>

<p>At once the owner of the house had prepared his trap and
the spring guns, while Shadow went back to the city to continue
the discouraging search for a criminal to whose identity
he had only the faintest possible clew.</p>

<p>Like a very shadow he was, as he silently stole hither and
thither, and glided in and out of the haunts of vice, searching
for the man who had done him a great wrong and had
aroused his enmity.</p>

<p>And then, ere night, his lips involuntarily parted, and the
long silence was unconsciously broken, as he fervently exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!"</p>

<p>His keen gaze rested on a man whom he felt an inward
conviction was the individual whom he had for so long in vain
endeavored to discover. And, with eyes beginning to flame,
the mysterious detective gradually drew nearer to the individual,
while one hand rested on his revolver.</p>

<p>Was the hour of his vengeance at hand?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">FUN!</p>


<p>Helen Dilt's brain had withstood the shock of the torture
to which she had been subjected by the human hyena who
presided over that establishment, called a "first-class private
asylum, where excellent care is guaranteed for those unfortunates
who are mentally deranged."</p>

<p>It was Tige's business to drive her crazy or kill her, and
apart from the sum to be made by boarding her after being
made mad, the fiend cared very little which fate she assigned
to Helen.</p>

<p>"I must try a few more tortures on her," muttered the
tigress, "and if she don't begin to weaken soon, I'll take the
bull by the horns and prepare her for transplanting."</p>

<p>The wretch laughed at her own facetiousness, and at once
took steps to have some more "fun," as she called it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was fun to her.</p>

<p>If everything that a person enjoys is fun, then it was fun for
her to torture her patients and watch the exhibition of their
anguish.</p>

<p>Poor Helen!</p>

<p>It was enough to make a heart of adamant soften to see her
lying there, quivering and shivering.</p>

<p>It was enough to cause the stoniest eyes to shed tears of
blood.</p>

<p>But Tige was not a human being.</p>

<p>It would be a libel on the whole human race to call her so.</p>

<p>She was rather a form of flesh and blood, without feeling,
without heart, the spirit, the life, which animated her being
that of Satan himself, or else one of his arch fiends.</p>

<p>A few words had been received from Brown.</p>

<p>They were to the effect that Tige was to endeavor, above
all things, to actually craze Helen. It suited his ends better.
But in case it was impossible to drive her mad, then to
kill her.</p>

<p>A keeper entered Helen's room, removed the gag, and motioned
her to eat.</p>

<p>She shook her head. She could not eat. He then offered
her some liquor or wine, but this she also refused.</p>

<p>"You must take something to keep up your strength," the
keeper said. "I've got orders to see that you take some wine,
and in this establishment orders has got to be obeyed, even if
I have to force the stuff down your grub-tube."</p>

<p>He placed a glass of wine to Helen's lips, and when she
would not take it&mdash;fearing poison&mdash;he throttled her, and when
she gasped let the wine run down her throat, almost strangling
her.</p>

<p>The keeper waited.</p>

<p>Finding that the wine was undrugged, so far as she could
tell, and feeling the generous glow it produced, she drank another
glass without compelling the keeper to resort to violence.</p>

<p>"Will you eat now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ain't you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"Better eat it," said the fellow. "Patients is never sure
here when they'll get another meal. If you ain't hungry now,
you might better eat this grub ag'in the time when you will
be."</p>

<p>But Helen motioned the food away.</p>

<p>She could not eat.</p>

<p>Before taking his leave, the fellow replaced the gag. When
Helen saw him take it up, and divined what he intended to
do, she filled her lungs for screaming.</p>

<p>But the keeper's eyes were quick ones.</p>

<p>He was accustomed to similar scenes, and quick as a flash
had Helen by the throat, and choked the first shriek short off.</p>

<p>"Now be quiet, curse you!" he hissed, as the poor girl's
tongue began to protrude. "You're mighty slow in learning
that it ain't best to kick against the pricks in this 'ere shebang."</p>

<p>Letting go of Helen's throat now, he deftly applied the gag
before she could recover sufficient breath to finish the cry for
help which he had choked down.</p>

<p>Then he left her.</p>

<p>An hour later she had another visitor.</p>

<p>It was Tige.</p>

<p>Helen was a brave girl. She had proved her courage when
in the cellar beneath the house of McGinnis, when the cruel
tide mounted higher and higher about her.</p>

<p>Yes, she was a brave girl.</p>

<p>There could be no question about that.</p>

<p>Yet she could not help cowering down in terror as she saw
her tormentor entering the room&mdash;could not help shrinking
down close to the bed, while cold chills crept up her spine,
accompanied by a feeling as if she were telescoping into herself.</p>

<p>Tige paused.</p>

<p>As she stood and gloated over this unconscious action of
Helen's, the fiendish woman gave utterance to a blood-chilling
chuckle.</p>

<p>The sight of this fear that was manifested for her, was the
highest compliment which Tige could be paid.</p>

<p>"Well, how does my deary feel after our last little picnic
party?" inquired Tige, as she approached the bed, her face
distorted by a horrible grimace.</p>

<p>Helen quivered from head to foot.</p>

<p>But she was silent.</p>

<p>The gag prevented all speech, smothered all sound, save
moans and groans, and these there was no occasion for now,
although there soon would be.</p>

<p>Helen's feet were still bare.</p>

<p>Toward these the hag directed her attention, and as a first
move lightly ran her fingers over the soles.</p>

<p>The victim drew them hastily up as far as the ropes about
her ankles permitted.</p>

<p>Tige exultantly chuckled.</p>

<p>Helen's feet were very sensitive.</p>

<p>There was a world of fun in store for the she-hyena.</p>

<p>From her pocket the human she-hyena now took a bunch of
feathers&mdash;innocent-looking things of themselves, but capable of
being made an instrument of terrible torture.</p>

<p>These feathers Tige commenced drawing over and brushing
around on the soles of Helen's feet.</p>

<p>It was torture indeed!</p>

<p>Torture!</p>

<p>The word does not describe it.</p>

<p>Soon Helen was writhing again, and straining again, until
the veins were swollen nearly to bursting.</p>

<p>It was agony to endure.</p>

<p>Don't you think so?</p>

<p>Well, try it.</p>

<p>It can be easily done; there is no costly apparatus to procure.
Just two or three feathers, to be drawn over your bare
feet.</p>

<p>Laughing, exultantly crowing, chuckling as she watched
the evidences of Helen's sufferings, the she-hyena pursued her
hideous work with relentless energy.</p>

<p>It was awful.</p>

<p>At last human nature could not stand it, and Helen went
into convulsions.</p>

<p>Then Tige threw down the feathers, and sprang to get a
pitcher of water.</p>

<p>"I must be quick," she muttered, "or she may die before I
can get her out of the fit."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OUT OF JEOPARDY.</p>


<p>We were in a fix of the worst possible description, and I
felt at that minute that no matter how important a capture I
might expect to make thereby, I would never again put myself
in seeming league with house-breakers.</p>

<p>No, sir!</p>

<p>Spring guns was just one too many to suit my taste.</p>

<p>This was my first experience in the art of "crib-cracking,"
and if I could only get safely out of this I felt that I should be
perfectly contented to have it my last as well as my first.</p>

<p>If you have never been in a similar situation you can only
have a faint conception of my feelings as I stood there, not
daring to move lest I might set those concealed springs to
going.</p>

<p>I do not think my bitterest enemy would accuse me of cowardice,
and I don't think that my trembling just then was the
result of cowardice on my part.</p>

<p>Such a feeling as came over me then I never had before and
have never had since.</p>

<p>In reaching for the button of the window Woglom's hand
was made a prisoner by the same means.</p>

<p>At once both commenced to wildly thrash about with their
heels, in an attempt to get loose and make their escape.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," I gasped, "keep your feet quiet.
You may set the infernal machine at work."</p>

<p>But they only thrashed harder.</p>

<p>I momentarily expected to be blown to pieces, to be riddled
by a teacupful of young bullets, a certainly not very pleasing
reflection.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that it was a singular sort of position for
a detective to be caught in, and I groaned as I thought of the
laugh my brother professionals would have at my expense.</p>

<p>That I would eventually be able to exonerate myself, I had
no doubt. But before I could do so I would of necessity be
obliged to spend the remainder of the present night, and possibly
several additional days and nights, in jail before being
set free.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant prospect.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was quite the contrary.</p>

<p>And it would, in all probability, hurt my standing in the
force, and give my envious enemies a handle for sneers and
innuendoes.</p>

<p>Some of these&mdash;and I knew I had enemies&mdash;would not hesitate
to hint that there was "a nigger in the fence;" in other
words, that I was not as innocent as I tried to make out.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I uttered an oath or two. In fact, I am
quite sure I did.</p>

<p>But how to help myself?</p>

<p>Was I to stand there like a stake until I was reached and
collared by the gardener and hostler, who had been hastily
roused, and whom I could now hear coming with heavy tread
down the stairs inside the house?</p>

<p>All the thrashing around of Woglom and his pal had not
started the spring guns.</p>

<p>This thought flashed across my brain.</p>

<p>Ha!</p>

<p>Perhaps the gentleman's statement of a whole battery of
these masked weapons was a fiction, designed to hold us spellbound
with fear.</p>

<p>There was a hope in the thought.</p>

<p>How my heart bounded!</p>

<p>I had often thought I could imagine just how a cornered
criminal feels, as he gathers himself, in very desperation, for
a dash for liberty.</p>

<p>But my imagination had never drawn so vivid a picture as
was painted by my situation and its natural feelings at that
moment.</p>

<p>I glanced up.</p>

<p>Out of the window that head still protruded, and the eyes in
it were watching me sharply.</p>

<p>The muzzle of the gun was directed at me point-blank.</p>

<p>The gentleman knew that the two others were trapped,
and so paid me the compliment of keeping me under surveillance.</p>

<p>I heard the back door of the house opened.</p>

<p>In a minute the gardener and hostler would be upon me.</p>

<p>I had no time to lose if I meant to make my escape.</p>

<p>And escape I must!</p>

<p>Two or three bounds would certainly carry me outside the
circle in which the spring-guns were concealed, if concealed
they were.</p>

<p>I gathered my muscles.</p>

<p>The watcher seemed to divine my intentions, for he sternly
called:</p>

<p>"Stand still there! If you move, or try to escape, I'll shoot
you down. I am not talking idly, but am in grim earnest."</p>

<p>I was satisfied of that from his tone.</p>

<p>But I must escape.</p>

<p>I would risk a shot at me.</p>

<p>Catching my breath, I took a big leap, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>He had been as good as his word.</p>

<p>I thought a swarm of bees were flying around my head.</p>

<p>But I had taken a second leap just in the nick of time, and,
unharmed, escaped the shower of big buckshot which would
have riddled my body, had not I been so quick.</p>

<p>A third and fourth leap, and then I took to my heels.</p>

<p>The fence barred my way.</p>

<p>And the gardener and his companion were close behind me.
I made no attempt to go out of the gate. Nor did I waste
time in climbing the fence.</p>

<p>I ran toward it for all I was worth, and bounded over it on
the fly, alighted safely on the other side, and then went down
the road like a streak of greased lightning.</p>

<p>"After him!&mdash;after him!&mdash;I can attend to these two!" I
heard an excited voice yell, and the two men obeyed the
order.</p>

<p>As I ran, I conned the situation.</p>

<p>I found that I could easily outstrip the lumbering workmen.
But that was not the thing. In an hour the whole country
would be aroused, and it would be impossible to get a train
back to the city without being collared.</p>

<p>A thought struck me.</p>

<p>Easing my pace, so as just to keep ahead of my pursuers, I
took off and turned my coat inside out (it was made reversible
for the purposes of disguise.)</p>

<p>I yanked off my false mustache, with a tiny pair of scissors
hastily trimmed down my false beard, and changed its shape.</p>

<p>A few other changes I was able to make without pausing,
and I felt sure I could then pass muster.</p>

<p>Suddenly halting short, I uttered a shout and then blazed
away with my revolver, and was still shooting when the puffing
men reached me.</p>

<p>"Were you after him?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. "Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Straight ahead. My!&mdash;how he did run! You can never
catch him."</p>

<p>"We can try," said they, and I joined with them in the
pursuit&mdash;of a phantom, now!</p>

<p>Finally giving up the pursuit, we turned our steps backward
over the course we had come. They told me what had happened,
and I informed them that I was a detective.</p>

<p>We reached the house.</p>

<p>The constable had been summoned, and the two rascals were
already in irons.</p>

<p>The display of my badge made me perfectly solid, and I was
taken into the confidence of the authorities when I&mdash;to their
surprise as well as that of Woglom and his pal&mdash;told the names
of the pair and gave their pedigree.</p>

<p>When in the light, I saw Woglom and his pal glance at me
rather hard. But the change in appearance was so great,
that, while they might suspect, they could not be sure that
Detective Howard was their recent companion.</p>

<p>Should the forgoing chapter be read by the inhabitants of
that little Jersey village, they will for the first time learn who
the third person of that burglarious trio really was.</p>

<p>I saw the rascals caged safely, and then returned to the
city, as thankful a man as ever stepped in two shoes.</p>

<p>No more such adventures for me.</p>

<p>I was perfectly satisfied with one such experience.</p>

<p>My next move was to try and find Shadow, whom I next saw
under very peculiar circumstances.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">WEAVING THE NET.</p>


<p>Was the hour of Shadow's vengeance at hand?</p>

<p>It would seem so, from the expression which came into his
face as he passed nearer to the man whom he believed he had
at last recognized.</p>

<p>An intense but suppressed excitement marked his every
movement.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!"</p>

<p>He had thus exclaimed a moment before while he was earnestly
scrutinizing the face of this person.</p>

<p>The fact that he could be surprised into breaking his long
and well-maintained silence spoke very strongly for his belief
that he had at last found the man he was in search of.</p>

<p>And that man was McGinnis.</p>

<p>When he left the place Shadow followed him.</p>

<p>Like a sleuth-hound he kept on the track of the evil man,
and so carefully did he time his movements, that the suspicions
of McGinnis were not aroused.</p>

<p>Light-footed as a cat, noiseless as a very shadow, gliding
along like a ghost, a better person than the mysterious little
detective could not have been found for the purposes of dogging
and pursuit.</p>

<p>Gradually the expression of excitement left his face, and it
became very stern and set.</p>

<p>It pictured a grim and unalterable purpose.</p>

<p>And that purpose was&mdash;vengeance!</p>

<p>That is, if McGinnis should prove to be the right man.</p>

<p>Shadow had been mistaken before, and there was a possibility
of his being so again.</p>

<p>But he was satisfied that this time he had found the right
man.</p>

<p>Earnestly he had studied the face of Helen Dilt's abductor,
and it exactly corresponded with the mental picture he had
formed of the individual he was after.</p>

<p>Such a likeness, he told himself, could hardly be the result
of accident.</p>

<p>A description which had been given him, every word of
which he had carefully treasured up, suited McGinnis perfectly
and in every particular.</p>

<p>And, as Shadow pursued, a grim smile began to play about
his lips.</p>

<p>"It is the man!" he muttered, again breaking through the
shield of silence with which he had so long kept himself surrounded.</p>

<p>"It is the man!" he muttered again. "My darling, you
shall be avenged soon."</p>

<p>Shadow knew that he had broken the self-imposed silence.</p>

<p>Yet he did not appear vexed, as he had when I forced him
to speak on a certain occasion.</p>

<p>Why was this?</p>

<p>It seemed to me as if he had vowed solemnly to utter no
word to living being until he had found the man he was after.</p>

<p>Satisfied that McGinnis was the person, he considered the
vow fulfilled.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, the true reason.</p>

<p>But was McGinnis the man?</p>

<p>As closely as "death hangs to a nigger," Shadow hung to
McGinnis, nor ever let him get out of his sight.</p>

<p>More than once the hand of the mysterious detective sought
the butt of his revolver, as it had done in the saloon, in the
first fever of excitement subsequent to the recognition.</p>

<p>An equal number of times, however, the fingers unclasped
from the weapon.</p>

<p>While McGinnis filled the bill as far as the description went,
and while Shadow would have staked his life that he was the
man, he had sense enough, and was cool enough, to be aware
that after all he might be mistaken.</p>

<p>He did not wish to kill the wrong man.</p>

<p>That would be worse than no revenge at all.</p>

<p>No, he must be sure beyond even the smallest doubt, before
he fired the fatal shot.</p>

<p>He must follow the same general plan he had followed for
so long&mdash;keep near the suspected man, waiting until he should
convict himself by his own word of mouth.</p>

<p>McGinnis had not the remotest idea that he was under surveillance,
and certainly did not dream that he was tracked to
his very door.</p>

<p>In the dark hours before the dawn a dark figure glided
around and around the shanty, ghost-like in the perfect silence
of its movements. It was Shadow surveying the lay of the
land.</p>

<p>He was seeking a mode of access to the house of McGinnis.</p>

<p>None was to be found.</p>

<p>It was secure from any but forcible entrance, and eavesdropping
from outside would be worse than useless.</p>

<p>Shadow saw this.</p>

<p>It did not stump him, however.</p>

<p>He knew the old saying, that there is more than one way of
killing a cat, and failing in one plan, he always was able to
invent another without much loss of time.</p>

<p>Just before daybreak Shadow withdrew from the vicinity of
McGinnis' house.</p>

<p>While in sight of it he paused, and had any one been near,
it would have been to see Shadow raise his hand and shake
that slender forefinger in that peculiar way of his.</p>

<p>Then he was gone.</p>

<p>Little dreaming of the mine that was preparing beneath his
feet, McGinnis, with plenty of money in his pockets, which
meant unlimited rum while it lasted, considered himself in
clover.</p>

<p>He did not issue from his house until just after sunset.</p>

<p>On his way up the street his attention was drawn to a rather
showy-looking woman&mdash;a blonde&mdash;coming from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>She was young, not much over twenty, was tolerably well
dressed, and wore a derby hat with a decidedly rakish air.</p>

<p>All told, there was a certain jauntiness about her bearing
telling so plain a story that most men would have turned aside
to let her pass.</p>

<p>Not so McGinnis.</p>

<p>He winked at her.</p>

<p>Without an instant's loss of time she winked back.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Bridget!" said he.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Pat!" was her rather free-and-easy reply, in a
jocular tone.</p>

<p>McGinnis paused short.</p>

<p>"Which way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Any way," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Walk along with me, then."</p>

<p>"Good enough."</p>

<p>McGinnis and the girl walked along side by side, the man
eying her in silence for a while. Then he asked:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Me? I'm called Daisy, mostly."</p>

<p>"Belong here?"</p>

<p>"No; just got to New York this morning from London. I
say, you old rooster, are you 'crooked?'"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented McGinnis.</p>

<p>"So am I. My pal was nabbed in London, but I managed
to escape the bobbies."</p>

<p>"What's your lay?" inquired McGinnis.</p>

<p>"'Whipes' and 'tickers' and such like."</p>

<p>Without following their conversation further, we shall advance
the time a few hours, and once again carry the reader
to one of those low saloons that are patronized by the "crooked"
and "flash."</p>

<p>At either side of a small table sat McGinnis and Daisy.</p>

<p>He was treating her and trying to induce her to join her fortunes
with his.</p>

<p>Daisy hung back.</p>

<p>McGinnis continued to argue earnestly&mdash;and to order drinks.</p>

<p>A shrewd observer might have noticed that, while McGinnis
swallowed all his liquor, the girl each time managed to dump
hers out beneath the table.</p>

<p>The liquor began to mount to McGinnis' head, seasoned
though it was.</p>

<p>He was becoming intoxicated.</p>

<p>He had been quite taken by the dashing manner of the girl
and was now rapidly becoming maudlin and correspondingly
affectionate.</p>

<p>He wanted to hug Daisy.</p>

<p>He put his arm around her, but she shook it off with a:</p>

<p>"Here, let's have another drink."</p>

<p>At last, when more than half intoxicated, he became very
confidential, and to impress Daisy with the desirability of her
taking him as her pal, began recounting his exploits in the
past.</p>

<p>Her eyes began to snap and sparkle, and she listened to
him with ill-concealed eagerness, while I, disguised, stood at
a little distance, looking on.</p>

<p>My eyes had rested on Daisy's face for an instant, as they
took in every inmate of the place. Back to her face my eyes
had wandered, attracted by a something that was familiar.</p>

<p>The heavy falling of a drunken man caused her to glance
around. Her eyes were directed at me for a second or two&mdash;and
instantly I was staggered.</p>

<p>Those eyes were Shadow's!</p>

<p>Daisy was Shadow.</p>

<p>If Shadow was Mat Morris, then Mat Morris was Daisy.</p>

<p>But could that be?</p>

<p>Could Mat Morris so artfully disguise himself? Could that
slender throat, and drooping shoulders, and swelling bust, belong
to a man?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"HELP IS HERE!"</p>


<p>Not because she pitied Helen, or wished to save her life as
a matter of humanity, but because she had received her orders,
Tige sprang to the task of getting her victim out of the convulsions
into which she had been thrown by torture.</p>

<p>Tige found it necessary to call for help, and did so.</p>

<p>For some time Helen's life hung as in a balance, and it was
a matter of doubt what the result would be.</p>

<p>But hard work carried off the palm of victory, and at last
Tige drew back with a satisfied grunt.</p>

<p>She next dismissed the person she had called to assist her.</p>

<p>Now her brow began to cloud with anger, directed at Helen,
for having unconsciously caused her some anxiety.</p>

<p>Anxious Tige had been, for she always endeavored to do
exactly as her partners wished, since by doing so she held them
bound to her by closer ties of interest, and thereby was enabled
to demand countenance, protection, and support from them.</p>

<p>It had been Brown's orders to kill Helen only as the extreme
alternative, his first wish being that she should be driven
mad.</p>

<p>Tige did not blame herself for Helen having gone into convulsions.</p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>In her estimation it was the victim's own fault, and Helen
must be made to suffer for having caused her so much trouble.</p>

<p>Wiping the perspiration from her forehead, Tige sat down
to await Helen's return to consciousness.</p>

<p>It occurred soon after.</p>

<p>The poor girl opened her eyes, saw Tige beside her, shuddered,
cowered down like a timid hare beset by a blood-hound,
and closed her eyes, to shut out the sight of her tormentor.</p>

<p>"A pretty girl you are, to give me so much trouble!"
growled Tige. "I'm going at you again for doing it."</p>

<p>On hearing these words, Helen began to shake, and a
second or two later she went into a fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>A gloating look came into Tige's face.</p>

<p>It was music to her ears, these hysterical sobs and moans
of her victim.</p>

<p>"The corner is turned," muttered Tige, as she stood beside
the bed, looking down on Helen.</p>

<p>She referred to the corner of Helen's reason. She meant
that the edge was entered.</p>

<p>Poor girl!</p>

<p>Never before in her life had she had a hysterical attack.</p>

<p>Her mind had been too healthy and strong for that, and it
indicated, as Tige said, that the turning point was reached.</p>

<p>A vigorous following up of the mental impressions left on
Helen's mind by the torture she had endured could not fail to
result in the dethronement of her reason.</p>

<p>Tige was too well posted in her business, however, to attempt
to torture Helen while suffering with hysterics. To
have done so must inevitably have resulted in an immediate
attack of convulsions again.</p>

<p>Instead, she took herself out of her victim's sight, and sent
in one of the attendants to look after her.</p>

<p>When Helen had become somewhat calm, she was offered
food, which, as before, she declined.</p>

<p>But of the really excellent wine she took three glasses.</p>

<p>Having sworn on a Bible, which was brought in, that she
would not shriek or cry for help, the attendant removed the
gag.</p>

<p>Sometimes gagged, sometimes not, sometimes bound to her
bed, and again left unbound, but never permitted to leave her
room, some days passed.</p>

<p>Several times each day Tige would pass suddenly into the
poor girl's presence, and no matter how composed Helen
might have been a minute before, the sight of her torturer at
once threw her into an excited state, at the same time inducing
a fear that caused her to retreat into a corner, quivering
and gasping for breath, while a cold dew that sprang from
every pore would bathe her entire body.</p>

<p>This was what Tige liked to see.</p>

<p>It indicated the state of Helen's mind, and kept her nerves
constantly in a state of tension.</p>

<p>Few people have any idea of the frailty of the tenure which
the human mind holds on reason, or how easily the mind can
be warped or upset.</p>

<p>Helen's appetite was tempted with good food, daintily prepared,
and rich wines were kept always at her hand. Of all
these she now partook freely, wondering at the kindness manifested
for her in this direction, but never once dreaming that
it was done to build up her physical strength, so that she
might stand a greater amount of torture without fainting, or
going into hysterics or convulsions.</p>

<p>So the days passed for a period, the length of which Helen
never knew.</p>

<p>She had flung herself on the bed one day, and had fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>She was awakened by her wrists and ankles being clutched
hold of. Opening her eyes, she saw Tige and two of the attendants
there.</p>

<p>The scream that arose to her lips was cut short by the
strong grip of the human she-hyena fastening on her throat.</p>

<p>When wrists and ankles had been secured to the four corners
of the bed, they proceeded to gag Helen, who was then
left alone with Tige.</p>

<p>This time the torture was one of burning with red-hot irons.</p>

<p>Tige had brought in with her a small charcoal furnace with
which to heat the implements of torture.</p>

<p>She first touched the irons to the soles of the victim's feet.</p>

<p>Then Tige touched the iron to the palms of Helen's hand.</p>

<p>It was terrible!</p>

<p>Helen had lived so generously that she was stronger in body
than when tortured before, and as she writhed and twisted
the ropes squeaked and strained.</p>

<p>A throe of anguish caused her to concentrate her strength
with one grand effort, and the rope that held her right hand
parted.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash she dragged off the gag, and madly shrieked
for help.</p>

<p>Tige sprang on her to throttle her, to choke her down; but
her hands became nerveless and her face like that of a corpse,
as a ringing voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Help is here!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">MAN OR WOMAN?</p>


<p>Man or woman?</p>

<p>I looked at the individual who was seated opposite to McGinnis,
and asked myself this question.</p>

<p>The glance of those eyes had assured me that Daisy was
Shadow.</p>

<p>But was Shadow man or woman?</p>

<p>Man I certainly believed him, and yet&mdash;well, I was dumfounded
if ever man was.</p>

<p>That swelling bust might be a work of art, but it seemed to
me that it arose and fell too naturally to be anything but
genuine.</p>

<p>True, I had had ample evidence of Shadow's ability in the
art of disguise, yet still I could hardly believe this to be all
making up.</p>

<p>Shadow saw that my eyes were upon him (or her), and also
that I had recognized him.</p>

<p>McGinnis had been so plied with drink by Shadow, that he
was too drunk to notice or understand the significance of a
motion of the mysterious detective's hand.</p>

<p>Yet it said to me as plainly as words could have done:</p>

<p>"Be circumspect. Be careful. Do not betray me. Go
away, and leave me to alone work out the scheme I have laid."</p>

<p>I obeyed.</p>

<p>I turned on my heel and left the place. As I was about to
pass through the door I glanced back.</p>

<p>McGinnis was becoming very affectionate, and was winding
his arm about Daisy's waist.</p>

<p>Since Daisy was Shadow we shall not mystify the reader,
but simply speak of him by the name to which we are accustomed.</p>

<p>"Say yes, Daisy, won't you?" said McGinnis, with a slobber
which he meant for a kiss.</p>

<p>An expression of intense disgust on the other's face was not
noticed by the drunken villain.</p>

<p>"I'll think over it," was the reply. "But there's one
thing, McGinnis, which I want you to understand, that I
won't take up with a slouch."</p>

<p>"I ain't no slouch," protested McGinnis. "Why, I've&mdash;&mdash;"
and then started again, he began recounting his exploits in a
boastful tone.</p>

<p>Shadow listened, his ears drinking in the other's words with
an avidity equal to that of the leech, as it sucks the blood of
the victim to which it has fastened.</p>

<p>The detective heard partially what he wished to hear, and
his eyes began to gleam with a red and dangerous light.</p>

<p>Deftly, and with a purpose, he now and then interpolated a
word to direct McGinnis' mind into other channels, and at
last the end toward which he had aimed was gained.</p>

<p>Out of his own mouth McGinnis had convicted himself.</p>

<p>Distinctly, unequivocally, he had fastened on himself a terrible
crime&mdash;a crime which it was Shadow's sworn purpose to
avenge.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!"</p>

<p>So earnestly did Shadow utter this exclamation that it
fixed the attention of McGinnis, stupid with drink as he was.</p>

<p>Shadow saw it, and hastened to remove the impression
made on the mind of the villain.</p>

<p>"Let's have another drink," said McGinnis, as soon as his
mind was again at ease.</p>

<p>"You've had enough," said Shadow.</p>

<p>"I want another drink," growled McGinnis, now in his
ugly state of intoxication.</p>

<p>"No," was the decided rejoinder.</p>

<p>McGinnis clenched his fist and brought it forcibly down on
the table.</p>

<p>He swore that he was not going to be dictated to by a
woman.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Shadow, coolly. "You were the one
who was anxious for a partnership. It wasn't me. If you
drink another drop I'll bust up the whole arrangement."</p>

<p>Muttering under his breath that he would tame her when
the time came, he nevertheless did not order the drink.</p>

<p>For Shadow's purpose McGinnis was now drunk enough.</p>

<p>"Come, let's get out of this," at last remarked Shadow.</p>

<p>"All right, Daisy," hiccoughed McGinnis. "Goin' home
with me, ain't ye?" with a leer.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Bully for you. You're a gal of the right stripe. Sail
ahead&mdash;give us a wing, though, for I'm kind o' unstiddy on
my pins. An' I say, you must be well seasoned, 'cause you
don't show the effects of this bout's much as I do."</p>

<p>"I've drank many a stout lad under the table," was the
laughing reply, and McGinnis looked at his Daisy more admiringly
than before.</p>

<p>Too drunk to know even where he was going, Shadow found
no trouble in leading the villain whither he wished, since McGinnis
now trusted him completely.</p>

<p>"What a mash!" McGinnis kept muttering to himself, and
every time they passed under a street-lamp he insisted on having
another look at his darling Daisy's face.</p>

<p>"What's zish?" he finally asked, reeling unsteadily and
glancing around. "What's zish? Where'sh the house? Zish
is a dock!"</p>

<p>Shadow had led him to a lonely and deserted pier on the
east side of town.</p>

<p>Click!</p>

<p>Click!</p>

<p>It was a pair of handcuffs that produced this clicking, as
they were snapped on McGinnis' wrists.</p>

<p>Realizing what had been done, and nearly sobered by the
shock of surprise, McGinnis started back, and, raising his hands
quickly, tried to bring the handcuffs down on Shadow's head.</p>

<p>Shadow started back in time to save himself.</p>

<p>Then McGinnis made an attempt to fly.</p>

<p>Shadow was too quick for him.</p>

<p>In less than a second he had drawn and cocked a revolver,
and with one spring reaching McGinnis' side, he planted the
muzzle against the villain's temple.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, unless you wish to die instantly!" Shadow sternly
said, and the villain paused and stood trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>McGinnis' head was more sobered than his body, and when
Shadow suddenly tripped him, his feet flew out from under
him, and down he heavily went.</p>

<p>Shadow seemed working in a systematic way, seemed to
have planned everything exactly as it happened, for when he
sprang on the fallen villain he held a gag in his hand.</p>

<p>At the revolver's muzzle McGinnis yielded, and permitted
the gag to be placed in his mouth.</p>

<p>Shadow next fastened his feet, and when the villain was perfectly
helpless the detective coolly sat down on the string-piece,
to wait until the liquor's effect had passed more away.</p>

<p>McGinnis' fear tended to sobering him quickly, and just as a
distant church-clock was striking ten, Shadow arose and then
knelt beside the villain, at whom he gazed with a fixed look
that indicated unalterable purpose.</p>

<p>"McGinnis, your time is short," the mysterious detective
sternly said. "Make your peace with Heaven if you can. In
three minutes you die!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the tone in which these words were
said.</p>

<p>McGinnis was by this time sober enough to understand
the full import of the words, and he began to writhe, and
strain, and try to burst his bonds.</p>

<p>The wisdom of Shadow's gagging him was now apparent,
for had he been free to do so, the villain would have bawled
and shrieked like a madman.</p>

<p>"I abhor a murderer, and I shudder at thoughts of murder,"
Shadow went coldly on. "But I stifle all such feelings
for the sake of avenging in a fitting manner the death of one
who was more than all the world to me, whom you robbed of
life. Now you know why this terrible fate has overtaken
you."</p>

<p>It was a fearful sight, that of this man struggling with such
fierce intensity to burst his bonds, to free his hands, to save
his life.</p>

<p>Like the Nemesis he was, Shadow remained kneeling beside
McGinnis, and in calm, cold voice, counted the expiring seconds.</p>

<p>"The three minutes are gone," he finally said, in a tone
that was harsh but unwavering, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Avenged!" muttered Shadow, as he glided away from the
spot a few minutes later. "Tom, I have kept my oath! Darling
Tom, the same fate that was meted out to you, I have
meted out to your murderer!"</p>

<p>Just as the clock struck eleven, and I was preparing for
bed, a note was brought to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Waiting for you. Important!</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Shadow</span>."<br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">CORNERED CRIMINALS.</p>


<p>"Are you ready for some sharp work?"</p>

<p>So I was greeted when I, as is almost needless to say, hurried
down-stairs in response to Shadow's note.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can talk, can you?" I said. "Yes, I am ready
for some sharp work. What have you on hand?" as I glanced
at him from head to foot.</p>

<p>The skirts were gone.</p>

<p>He was again the slenderly-built youth that I had seen on
first making his acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you at the proper time," was the cool reply. "For
the present do as I say. Get a dozen men as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>It did not take me long to do this.</p>

<p>Then, under Shadow's guidance, we were conducted to the
vicinity of the private insane asylum in which Helen Dilt was
held a prisoner.</p>

<p>Stationing the men so that they would not be seen, Shadow
and I ascended the steps, and he rang the bell.</p>

<p>Soon the door opened a couple of inches, being prevented
from opening further by a stout chain attached to it. But
for this we should have thrown ourselves against it and forced
our way in.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?" was asked from
within.</p>

<p>"I came from Mr. Brown," Shadow promptly replied.</p>

<p>"What of him?" asked the cautious individual inside.</p>

<p>"He has sent me with a message to Tige concerning his
patient, whom I am also commanded to see with my own
eyes."</p>

<p>Satisfied by this display of knowledge, the fellow unfastened
the chain and Shadow glided in. I sprang out from behind
the pillar which had concealed me, and forced my way in just
as Shadow clapped a revolver to the villain's head.</p>

<p>"Give an alarm at your peril!" hissed Shadow, and dragged
him away from the door, which I at once swung open and
admitted the men.</p>

<p>Handcuffs had been brought in plenty, and the keeper who
had opened the door for us soon had a pair of them on his
wrists.</p>

<p>Over the building the men scattered with as little noise as
possible.</p>

<p>Tige was so wrapped up in her devilish work as to have
heard none of the noise that could not be entirely avoided, and
she knew not that her sins had found her out, until, in a ringing
voice, Shadow cried out:</p>

<p>"Help is here!"</p>

<p>Helen Dilt uttered one sob, and then became very silent.</p>

<p>She was not dead, however.</p>

<p>Shadow sprang to her side even as I secured the tigerish
woman, and he said that she had only fainted.</p>

<p>The tenderness of his manner, the way in which he commenced
to bathe Helen's face, led me to inquire:</p>

<p>"Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"It is Helen Dilt!" he returned.</p>

<p>Helen Dilt!</p>

<p>I remembered the name. It was the foster-sister, the intended
wife of Mat Morris.</p>

<p>Curiously I awaited Helen's return to consciousness, after
having ironed Tige and turned her over to the custody of one
of the men.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes at last.</p>

<p>She did not fling her arms about Shadow's neck, did not
call him Mat, did not seem to recognize him.</p>

<p>Then Shadow was not Mat Morris!</p>

<p>This much was clear.</p>

<p>Who, then, was Shadow?</p>

<p>The mystery fretted me not a little.</p>

<p>"Are you ready for further work?" coolly asked Shadow,
turning to me a minute later.</p>

<p>"Yes. Will we need as many men?"</p>

<p>"All but one. You can spare one to remain in charge
here. Let the others march the prisoners to the station-house,
and then follow me."</p>

<p>"Are we going to bag more game to-night?" inquired one
of the men.</p>

<p>Shadow heard the question.</p>

<p>"Yes," he promptly returned. "There are plenty more to
bag; but in bagging the next lot I'd advise you to keep your
pops ready."</p>

<p>Our prisoners once safely in custody, Shadow led us by the
shortest route toward the East River.</p>

<p>I guessed his destination this time.</p>

<p>"The old sugar-house?" I inquiringly said.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the brief reply.</p>

<p>"How do you expect to gain entrance?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to me."</p>

<p>I did leave it to him.</p>

<p>Great was my surprise when he led us by his secret entrance
into the vaults beneath the old sugar-house.</p>

<p>I now began to understand how he had escaped&mdash;that is, if
Shadow it was who had been confined in the Black Hole.</p>

<p>This latter I was now beginning to doubt.</p>

<p>Carefully we crossed the last of the series of vaults, and
paused at the foot of the stairs leading up to the store-room,
where I had once had a most exciting adventure.</p>

<p>Shadow softly mounted first.</p>

<p>I followed.</p>

<p>In the office, at the further end, Cap and some of the men
were gathered, earnestly consulting about something.</p>

<p>The men were called up.</p>

<p>One was instructed to look after the door-keeper.</p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>Shadow gave the word.</p>

<p>We rushed forward, every man with a brace of revolvers in
his hands, and when I called on the rascals to throw up their
hands, they cast one glance at the gleaming array of "barkers"
and raised their hands.</p>

<p>Happily, Shadow's augury was forestalled.</p>

<p>We bagged as dangerous a lot of men as ever were banded
together, and without firing a single shot. Unexpectedly taken
as they were, they had no time to prepare for defense.</p>

<p>"Now for the Black Hole," said Shadow, when all the captives
were in irons.</p>

<p>I followed him.</p>

<p>In the vaults he called loudly:</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;ho!&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>Soon came back a smothered reply, and we finally were led
to a heavy wooden door secured by stout locks. As we
could not open the latter, we proceeded to batter down the
door, and released, in a half-starved condition&mdash;Mat Morris!</p>

<p>Shadow gave me no opportunity to indulge in feelings of
surprise, or to obtain any information whatever concerning the
mystery.</p>

<p>"Waste no time!" he said, coldly. "We have more work
yet to-night."</p>

<p>Five of the men were left in the sugar-house to bag any
members of the gang who might come straggling along. The
others, with Shadow and myself, went to the station-house with
the captives.</p>

<p>Between us walked poor Mat Morris, so weak that he could
hardly stand.</p>

<p>"Take only two men this time," said Shadow, after we had
reached the station; and so with two men we departed&mdash;to be
surprised, I felt, as well as to surprise somebody else.</p>

<p>I was not wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Brown was awakened by the ringing of his doorbell,
and when he demanded what was the matter, was told
that an intimate friend was dying and had sent for him.</p>

<p>When he came out we nabbed him, and within half an hour
later, despite his protestations, he was behind the bars of a
cell.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE MYSTERY EXPLAINED.</p>


<p>During the next afternoon all of the most active parties in
this written drama were congregated in the parlor belonging
to a suite of rooms at one of our second-class hotels.</p>

<p>Here Mat Morris had been taken, as he could be more comfortable
here than at any other place, not knowing where to
find his mother.</p>

<p>Here also had Helen Dilt been conveyed in a carriage.</p>

<p>Shadow was there.</p>

<p>And lastly, I had just put in an appearance.</p>

<p>Both Mat and Helen understood that to Shadow they owed
their deliverance, and both were deeply grateful and could not
thank him enough.</p>

<p>After a while I said plainly that there was a mystery underlying
all this which I should like to have explained.</p>

<p>"You shall hear the explanation," said Shadow. "I am
not what I seem; I am not a man; I am Nellie Millbank, to
whom you were kind enough&mdash;although a stranger&mdash;to lend
the money with which to decently inter the body of her murdered
lover."</p>

<p>"I sometimes suspected as much," I said, while Mat and
Helen both opened their eyes with surprise at learning that
Shadow was a woman.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to Shadow, "it was to you whom I paid
five hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then"&mdash;to Mat&mdash;"how was it possible for you to send
that same five hundred dollars to your mother?"</p>

<p>"I found the money," said Mat.</p>

<p>"I lost it," said Shadow.</p>

<p>Here was one of those little things which had so deeply puzzled
me made light as day.</p>

<p>By questioning, by listening when all the parties talked
freely, I finally understood all the ins and outs of the thrilling
drama in real life.</p>

<p>In his search after Helen, and in his endeavor to find her
abductor, Mat had been engaged only a short while when he
rendered himself suspected by the sugar-house gang, had been
arrested and clapped into the Black Hole, where he had been
kept a close prisoner ever since.</p>

<p>So it turned out that Mat Morris, whom I had believed the
most active character in the drama, was for the greater part
of the time kept in a condition of forced inactivity.</p>

<p>Nellie Millbank told me how, after having seen her lover
laid away in his resting-place, she had taken an oath to
avenge his death.</p>

<p>Knowing how slight a clew she had on which to work&mdash;the
most vague description of the murderer&mdash;she had adopted a
male attire, and started out with the plan of insinuating herself
into the confidence of such a man as she might suspect,
and lead him to convicting himself.</p>

<p>Starting out on this plan, she had just caught sight of an
individual whom she thought answered the description of the
murderer, and was shaking her finger after him when I saw
her shadow.</p>

<p>She heard the remark I dropped at the time, and, when she
afterward wrote to me, she adopted the name my remark had
suggested.</p>

<p>The five hundred dollars I gave to her she had lost, and
Mat Morris had found, which explained the complications
arising from finding bills which I recognized in the hands of
Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>I also then learned how it was that Shadow had come to be
in the sugar-house at the time of handing me that note, although
that is something concerning which the reader needs
no explanation, the detective's purpose being made evident at
the time.</p>

<p>And this is so as regards many other incidents in connection
with Shadow, mysteries to me at the time of their occurrence,
but made plain to the reader in various places.</p>

<p>And this is so also as regards Helen Dilt.</p>

<p>We had all her adventures and experiences to listen to,
which have been recorded in their proper places.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Mrs. Morris, who had been sent for,
put in an appearance, having been found and sent here.</p>

<p>A happier woman never drew the breath of life than she
was when she was enabled to clasp both her loved ones to her
heart.</p>

<p>Nellie Millbank and I drew a little apart, that the others
might have the first few minutes of meeting to themselves.</p>

<p>In response to a question of mine as to how she had gathered
up all the threads of the tangled skein, she replied:</p>

<p>"It was through McGinnis. He was the tool of Brown,
the abductor of Helen, as well as the murderer of my lost one.
I suspected him rightly, after many previous failures, threw
myself in his way in the character of a thing which I care not
to name, and when he was in liquor he told me all. He convicted
himself out of his own mouth."</p>

<p>"Where is McGinnis?"</p>

<p>Shadow turned away. He pretended not to have heard my
question, and I did not press it.</p>

<p>Together we five had supped, and a right merry party it
was&mdash;although I thought that the merriment of Nellie Millbank
was rather forced.</p>

<p>This I thought might be because of a natural embarrassment
at being in men's clothing after having revealed her
true sex.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon I had heard of the discovery of a
dead body on an East River pier. The man was handcuffed
and gagged, and had been repeatedly stabbed. Already it
was becoming spoken of as the most brutal murder on
record.</p>

<p>That evening I was sent to look at the body and to give any
assistance I could toward working up the case.</p>

<p>The moment I reached the Morgue and the sheet was drawn
down, I understood the reason why Shadow had pretended not
to hear my question.</p>

<p>The body was that of McGinnis.</p>

<p>On his breast had been found pinned a bit of paper, bearing
these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This man died a righteous death. He was a murderer,
and meets the same fate he dealt to another. His victim is
avenged.</p>

<p>"Search for the person who inflicted this punishment will
be in vain."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This last sentence several shrewd detectives thought implied
that the writer intended self-destruction.</p>

<p>This view I bolstered up to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the murderer of McGinnis was never discovered.</p>

<p>In fact, none of us who knew Shadow&mdash;confound it! Nellie
Millbank&mdash;ever saw her afterward, unless&mdash;&mdash; Well, one day
long afterward I entered a horse-car; opposite to me sat two
black-garbed sisters of mercy. For just one fleeting second
the eyes of one of them encountered mine.</p>

<p>It may not have been Nellie Millbank, but I have always
thought it was, and hope that I was right.</p>

<p>Dick Stanton, the false detective, was brought from the private
cell in which I had placed him, and was convicted and
"sent up" with the rest of the sugar-house gang.</p>

<p>Tige and her companion hyenas were roughly dealt with.</p>

<p>Murder was charged to their account, and was so well sustained
that they all received life sentences.</p>

<p>Brown was sent to prison for twenty years, a sentence long
enough to insure his never leaving the prison alive.</p>

<p>Helen Dilt was not long kept out of the money which her
rascally uncle had so long deprived her of, and the first thing
she did was to buy and present to her kind benefactress, Mrs.
Morris, a completely furnished home.</p>

<p>Not so very long since I met a gentleman in the street, who
clasped me warmly by the hand, as he said:</p>

<p>"Howard, it's a boy, and we think of naming it after you."</p>

<p>The speaker was Mat Morris.</p>

<p>He and Helen have been married some years now, and this
boy he spoke of is not the first baby by&mdash;well, a few.</p>

<p>And thus we draw to a close, and with genuine regret bid
adieu to the history of the strange being who was so long a
mystery to me under the indefinite title of <span class="smcap">Shadow</span>.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
